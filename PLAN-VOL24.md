# PLAN-VOL24 — the `/24h` volume endpoint is broken; compose the real rolling-24h from `/1h`

Per-topic plan (folds into `PLAN.md` and is deleted when its last chunk ships — the plan-file rule).

## The finding (investigated 2026-07-13, empirically confirmed)

The tool's `Vol/d` column and every liquidity gate/rank consume
`volDay = min(highPriceVolume, lowPriceVolume)` from the OSRS wiki `/24h` endpoint. **`/24h` is NOT a
rolling-24h window.** Live probing showed:

- The `/24h` response (bulk AND per-item — identical) carried a `timestamp` field ~26h stale, and the
  served hpv/lpv **exactly matched** (zero delta, both sides, multiple items) the sum of the `/5m`/`/1h`
  buckets over just the **first 1–3 hours of that stale UTC day**.
- Across 14 days of `/24h?timestamp=` daily buckets (and the identical `/timeseries?timestep=24h`), every
  day was truncated to its first 1–3 hours (bucket ÷ true-day-sum = 0.006–0.21).
- Net effect at investigation time: the live `/24h` reported **0.037–0.10×** the true trailing-24h volume
  (a ~10–27× under-report). It is worst in early/mid-UTC hours — i.e. Ben's US-Pacific afternoon/evening
  sessions — so the ~100/day two-sided floor, the 500k gp/d attention floor, gp-flow admission
  (`mid × limitVol`), and the rank/`expGpDay`/overnight `expUnits` are all systematically understated
  exactly when he trades, over-gating the mid-liquidity lane.
- `/5m`, `/1h`, `/6h` are healthy (each serves the last complete bucket, fresh). Only the `/24h`
  aggregation grain is broken. `/24h` is also undocumented on the wiki API page.
- **Side-casualty**: the `pressure` ratio and the `/24h` `avgHigh`/`avgLow` (gatecandidates' `mid`, the dip
  "24h avg low" reference) come from the same frozen bucket — treat them as ~26h-stale 1–3h samples too.

**Confidence**: HIGH on "what it serves now" (exact integer matches, both sides, many items, 14d of
history). Inferred (not proven beyond 14d): how long it has been broken — plausibly the repo's whole
operating history, meaning every volume-denominated threshold was tuned against deflated numbers.

## The fix (source): compose rolling-24h from the healthy `/1h` grain

There is NO single-fetch bulk source of true rolling-24h volume (`/volumes` is one unsplit ~13h-stale
daily number with no hpv/lpv split → can't feed the two-sided gate; it confirms the existing
"overstates tradability" doctrine). The only exact whole-market path is composing 24 bulk
`/1h?timestamp=` snapshots — the same grid-aligned pattern `loadBands`/`loadDaily` already use.

- **`rolling24FromTs1h(ts1h)`** (`pipeline/lib/marketfetch.mjs`) — TRUE trailing-24h
  `{highPriceVolume, lowPriceVolume, avgHighPrice, avgLowPrice}` for ONE item, summed off an
  already-fetched `/timeseries?timestep=1h` array → **zero new fetch** on a row whose 1h series is in hand
  (screen survivors via Leg B, quote COD-4). avg prices = volume-weighted 24h means.
- **`loadAll24hRolling({db})`** — the WHOLE-MARKET map, from the last 24 complete `/1h?timestamp` bulk
  windows, **reusing the Tier-1 SQLite 1h archive** (check-before-fetch: `loadSnapshot`/`loadDaily` already
  accrue some of these buckets, so a warm machine fetches only the gaps). 10-min disk cache mirrors
  `loadAll24h`. Same per-id shape as `loadAll24h` → sources are swappable with no shape change.

Proven **EXACT** vs a per-item timeseries sum: 10/10 items, hpv AND lpv (2026-07-13). Cold cost measured:
24 bulk fetches, ~5s, ~4080 items — cheaper than the 5m band walk.

## Accuracy: Proposal A (cheap scale-factor) is DEAD; B (compose) is exact

Two proposals were sketched. Prototype comparison (limiting-side volDay, window
[07-13 02:00 → 07-14 02:00 UTC]):

- **Proposal A** (multiply `/24h` by `24 / hoursSinceUTCmidnight`) is **rejected**: its premise
  ("cumulative since UTC midnight") is false — the bucket is a frozen 1–3h slice of *yesterday*. At the
  probe hour the factor coincidentally roughly cancelled the under-report, still leaving ±58% scatter; the
  coincidence collapses as the day advances (at 20:00 UTC the ×1.2 factor against ~10–27×-under data would
  report ~5–15% of true), plus near-midnight division instability. A confidently-wrong number is worse
  than a flagged degraded one.
- **Proposal B** (compose from `/1h`) is exact by construction and is what shipped.

## Step plan

### Step 1 — corrected source, SHADOW-only ✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-13
- `loadAll24hRolling` + `rolling24FromTs1h` added to `pipeline/lib/marketfetch.mjs`.
- **The active `volDay` is UNCHANGED.** `screen.mjs` still gates/displays/ranks off the broken `/24h`
  value (`loadAll24h`) so `screen.json`, the replay goldens, and every live decision stay byte-identical
  and NO extra fetch is added on the default path. The corrected source is reachable only via the new
  **`screen.mjs --vol-source legacy|rolling`** flag (default `legacy`) — the validation lever for step 2.
- **Shadow accrual**: every published screen row logs the corrected per-item volume as a lean
  `volDayRolling: {hpv,lpv}` on `suggestions.jsonl` (computed from the in-hand 1h series → no new fetch;
  omitted where no 1h series is in hand, e.g. watchlist rows). `SCREEN_PARAMS.volSource` records which
  source gated the run.
- Node-only. **No APP_VERSION bump** (the browser app is untouched — deferred to step 3). Docs reconciled:
  `CLAUDE.md` Vol/d line, `README.md` registry (marketfetch + this file), `pipeline/lib/suggestlog.mjs`
  schema.

### Step 2 — recalibrate every volume-denominated floor + flip the default to rolling ✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-13 (Ben-validated)
The `--mode all --stats` legacy-vs-rolling side-by-side confirmed the flood (BAND gated 23→238, CHURN
1→135, VALUE admitted 124→550, dip-pool +40). The `rolling/legacy` volDay ratio is HUGELY dispersed
(p10 7.8× · median 23.0× · p90 173×), so a flat multiplier is wrong — each floor was **count-matched** to
the corrected distribution (the floor that admits ≈ the same item count the old floor did under legacy):

| Constant | old | new | basis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FLOOR` / `VALUE_LIQ_FLOOR` / band `thin` (`limitVol<FLOOR`) | 50 | **3,500** | count-matched (884 items; rounded 3,652→3,500, leaning looser per Ben's surface-the-lane intent) |
| `CHURN_MIN_VOL` | 2,000 | **65,000** | count-matched (361) |
| `DIP_LOOP_LIQUID_FLOOR` | 1,000 | **40,000** | count-matched (438; rounded from 42,425) |
| `GP_FLOOR` | 250m | **4,500m** | count-matched gp-flow (89; ~18×) |
| `DL4_MIN_GP_FLOW` | 500k | **9m** | GP_FLOOR's ~18× applied to DL4's own 500k turnover floor (NOT tied to MIN_GPD) |
| `DL4_MIN_ABS_SWING` | 50 | **50 (unchanged)** | per-unit price swing, not volume-linked |
| `MIN_GPD` (attention floor) | 500k | **500k (unchanged)** | Ben's call: it's a real NET-throughput quantity — 500k of TRUE throughput is the honest floor; now surfaces the smaller real-throughput lane |

Default `--vol-source` flipped to `rolling`; `legacy` kept as an escape hatch. Replay goldens regenerated
(recorded inputs now flow through the new floor constants). **Combined-effect check confirmed** (see the
"Combined-effect verification" below) — the mid-liquidity commodity lane surfaces, ghost-spread thin items
stay gated, and keeping MIN_GPD at 500k is NOT moot (it binds, not FLOOR, for the small lane).

### Step 3 — REMAINING: fix the browser app (deferred, APP_VERSION-bumping)
The pipeline (`screen.mjs`) is fixed; the browser app's `js/marketfetch.js` (`fetch24h`, feeding the
Finder Grade/sort, Watch tab, Trends Vol/d) STILL reads the broken `/24h`. So the published `screen.json`
Scan tab is now MORE correct than the live app until this lands. Per-item the app can sum its own 1h
series; the Finder's bulk read needs a design decision (24 bulk `/1h` fetches per Finder load, or read a
published rolling snapshot). This is the `APP_VERSION`-bumping change; the pipeline fix is not.

### Combined-effect verification (2026-07-13, applied config: rolling + new floors + MIN_GPD 500k)
`node pipeline/screen.mjs --mode all --stats` on the EXACT applied config:

| Niche | legacy (broken /24h, old floors) | rolling + OLD floors (the flood) | **rolling + NEW floors (applied)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BAND gated / surfaced | 23 / 6 | 238 / 36 | **137 / 34** |
| CHURN gated / surfaced | 1 / 0 | 135 / 6 | **96 / 10** |
| VALUE admitted / shown | 124 / 22 | 550 / 20 | **122 / 22** |
| unique items fetched | 32 | 96 | **77** |
| Dip-pool added this scan | 0 | 40 (flood) | **1** (DL4 recal fixed the flood) |

The recalibration lands BETWEEN the over-tight legacy and the flood — the mid/small-liquidity lane surfaces
without the 238-gated blow-up. Newly-admitted sample (all two-sided, Vol/d = corrected rolling): big tickets
(Noxious halberd 45m, Dragon claws, Armadyl crossbow) AND the smaller real-throughput lane — Kourend teleport
tab (20.7k/d), Super strength(4) (136k/d), Blue dragon leather (278k/d), Snape grass/Torstol seed (~14k/d),
Divine ranging potion(4) (6.8k/d); CHURN commodities Black chinchompa (408k/d), Sanfew serum(4), Anglerfish,
Dragon bones, Saradomin brew(4), Mahogany plank (1.39m/d). Ghost-spread thin items stay gated (the two-sided
`hpv>0 && lpv>0` floor is untouched).

**MIN_GPD-500k combined-effect check — NOT moot, strongly BINDING.** Holding the new FLOOR fixed and raising
MIN_GPD 500k → 5m collapses BAND gated **139 → 30** (surfaced 34 → 5). So the ~109 lower-throughput band
candidates that surface are admitted specifically BECAUSE MIN_GPD stays at 500k — FLOOR (a unit floor) is NOT
the sole binding gate, and Ben's smaller real-throughput lane genuinely appears. Keeping MIN_GPD at 500k was
the operative choice, not a no-op.
