# The Coffer — OSRS Grand Exchange flipping tool

**Live: https://bensumm.github.io/The-Ledger/**

A self-contained web app for finding and managing OSRS Grand Exchange flips. Vanilla
JS, no build step, no framework, no bundler — plain static files served by GitHub
Pages. Installable as a PWA (works on desktop and iOS home screen), but primary
development is now on desktop.

Every price/margin in the app is **after the 2% GE sell tax** (floored per item,
capped at 5m, none under 50gp). Price convention follows flipper usage: **Buy** =
the instasell price (where you place buy offers), **Sell** = the instabuy price.

## What it does

- **Finder** — ranks flippable items by a budget-aware **rating** (profit/hr × a
  quality dampener blending ROI, liquidity, stability, and turnaround; hover the Risk
  grade for the per-factor breakdown). Stability here is a cheap live-price-vs-guide
  proxy — the full regime-drift check lives on the Trends page. Sortable by rating,
  profit/hr, margin, ROI, or volume.
- **Trends** — deep per-item analysis. A live "Suggested plan" (instant buy/sell +
  **patient pricing** that sizes a wider-margin offer off the recent 2h range),
  a **regime-shift guard** that warns when a recent price-level jump makes the
  hourly-timing stats unreliable, a plain-language guide-divergence readout
  ("Why this trend?"), 3-month price history, and a collapsible **timing &
  seasonality** section gated on a walk-forward backtest (hourly charts only appear
  when the timing edge is actually proven out-of-sample).
- **Watchlist / Signals** — star items to track; live buy signals fire when a
  watched item has an after-tax spread during its historically-cheap window.
- **Ledger** — manual position tracking with after-tax realized/unrealized P/L,
  summarized in the "Coffer" header tiles.
- **Fill-data pipeline** — see `pipeline/` (below): captures real GE trades from
  RuneLite to `fills.json` so the tool can eventually calibrate its predictions
  against actual fills.

## Files

- `index.html` — the app shell (markup only)
- `styles.css` — all styles
- `js/` — app logic as ES modules: `state.js` (shared mutable state as one `STATE`
  object + constants + persistence + diagnostics), `format.js` (formatting/tax),
  `charts.js` (inline SVG), `market.js` (price/guide fetch + scoring), `trends.js`
  (archive + seasonal analysis + regime/patient/backtest), `ui.js`
  (Finder/Watchlist/Signals/Ledger/Coffer rendering), `backup.js` (export/import),
  `main.js` (entry point — event wiring + init, loaded as `<script type="module">`)
- `manifest.json`, `icon-*.png` — PWA manifest and icons
- `fills.json` — raw real-trade event stream synced from RuneLite, fetched same-origin
- `positions.json` — derived from `fills.json` by the pipeline (FIFO-matched closed
  trades + open positions); the app auto-populates its Ledger/Coffer from it
- `pipeline/` — RuneLite fill-data pipeline (sync script, wrapper scripts, design
  doc); not served by Pages, not part of the app. See `pipeline/FILLS-PIPELINE.md`.

## Local development

ES module scripts can't load over `file://` (browsers block it for CORS reasons),
so double-clicking `index.html` won't work. Run **`serve.cmd`** (tries the `py`
launcher's `http.server`, falls back to `python3`, then `npx serve`) and open
`http://localhost:8000/`. GitHub Pages is unaffected — it always serves over HTTP.

Data sources are the OSRS Wiki real-time prices API, the in-game GE guide price
(wiki module + weirdgloop history), all fetched client-side.

## Deploy

`git push` to `main` auto-deploys via GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → deploy from
`main` / root). There is **no service worker**, so there's no cache to invalidate —
the next launch serves the new files. Deploy typically lands within ~1 minute.

## Persistence

State lives in **IndexedDB** (ledger, watchlist, settings, the growing hourly price
archives, cached snapshots), with a `localStorage`/in-memory fallback. Use the in-app
**Export** button periodically as a backstop — browsers can evict site storage under
pressure, even for installed PWAs. Export/Import round-trips the full state as JSON.

## Notes for future work

- A service worker (network-first for the HTML) would add an offline shell, but the
  app needs the live wiki API to be useful, so it was intentionally omitted.
- For an edge-to-edge iOS look: switch `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` to
  `black-translucent`, add `viewport-fit=cover` to the viewport meta, pad the header
  with `env(safe-area-inset-top)`.
