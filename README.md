# The Coffer — OSRS Grand Exchange flipping tool

**Live: https://bensumm.github.io/The-Ledger/**

A self-contained web app for finding and managing OSRS Grand Exchange flips. Vanilla
JS, no build step, no framework, no bundler — plain static files served by GitHub
Pages. Installable as a PWA (works on desktop and iOS home screen), but primary
development is now on desktop.

Every price/margin in the app is **after the 2% GE sell tax** (floored per item,
capped at 5m, none under 50gp). Price convention follows flipper usage: **Buy** =
the instasell price (where you place buy offers), **Sell** = the instabuy price.

## What it does

- **Finder** — ranks flippable items by a budget-aware **rating** (profit/hr × a
  quality dampener blending ROI, liquidity, stability, and turnaround; hover the Risk
  grade for the per-factor breakdown). Stability here is a cheap live-price-vs-guide
  proxy — the full regime-drift check lives on the Trends page. Sortable by rating,
  profit/hr, margin, ROI, or volume. Typing a **search** query reveals *every* mapped
  match — including cheap items (soul rune ~300gp) the browse-mode price floor normally
  hides; those search-only rows show `—` for the rating columns and lean on the quote
  button + star.
- **Trends** — deep per-item analysis. A live "Suggested plan" (instant buy/sell +
  **patient pricing** that sizes a wider-margin offer off the recent 2h range),
  a **regime-shift guard** that warns when a recent price-level jump makes the
  hourly-timing stats unreliable, a plain-language guide-divergence readout
  ("Why this trend?"), 3-month price history, and a collapsible **timing &
  seasonality** section gated on a walk-forward backtest (hourly charts only appear
  when the timing edge is actually proven out-of-sample).
- **Watchlist** — star items to track their live margins each refresh; the same
  starred set is the repo-shared watchlist the pipeline scans. (The old **Signals**
  tab — live cheap-window buy signals — was removed in 0.57.0; Ben didn't use it.)
- **Ledger** — per-item grouped open/closed positions with after-tax realized/unrealized P/L,
  summarized in the "Coffer" header tiles. Item names link to Trends; multi-lot groups expand via a
  chevron; a "P&L by" Day/Week/Month control on the Closed-flips header drives a period strip whose
  buckets click to filter the table by sell date; the manual-entry form is a collapsible section and the
  closed columns are sortable.
- **Fill-data pipeline** — see `pipeline/` (below): captures real GE trades from
  RuneLite to `fills.json` so the tool can eventually calibrate its predictions
  against actual fills.

## Files

- `index.html` — the app shell (markup only)
- `styles.css` — all styles
- `js/` — app logic as ES modules: `state.js` (shared mutable state as one `STATE`
  object + constants + persistence + diagnostics), `format.js` (formatting/tax —
  the canonical `tax()`/`netMargin`/`netMarginQty` helpers + the ONE **BOND tax exception**
  `BOND_ID`/`isBond`/`bondFee`: a bond is tax-exempt but pays a 10%-of-guide retrade fee, so
  `netMargin(low,high,{bond,guide})` = `sell − (buy + fee)`, tax-free), `charts.js`
  (static inline SVG — `svgLine`/`svgBars`, fixed-size, no interaction; still used by the
  Trends hourly seasonality charts + the quote sparkline), `chartlib.js` (CL — the reusable
  **interactive** SVG chart: `createChart(container,{series,overlay,fillBetween,refs,bands,markers,
  kind,yFmt,xFmt,spans,span})` → `{setSpan,destroy}` handle, with pointer-drag PAN, wheel/pinch ZOOM about the
  cursor, a span selector, y-axis auto-rescale to the visible window, a hover tooltip + crosshair,
  and a `DEFAULT_SPANS` export. Max zoom-in is density-floored (~4 sample points, `medGap*4`) so you
  can't zoom into empty space; explicit span buttons bypass that floor to hit their exact duration.
  Degrades to a no-op on a missing container or empty series. An optional `overlay` second line +
  `fillBetween` shading draws the Forward-forecast low/high CONE (0.61.0; absent config ⇒ byte-identical
  single-series). Consumed by `trends.js` — the **Recent movement** (2h), **Price history** (1/7/30/90d
  windows), **Diurnal timing** (7d/28d toggle), and **Forward forecast** (cone) charts; more surfaces
  adopt it over time. ADDITIVE — `charts.js` stays intact), `marketfetch.js` (shared browser fetch layer — one timeout-guarded `jget`
  + one cached `fetchTs`/`fetch24h` store, A2), `market.js`
  (price/guide fetch + scoring; keeps the bond in the catalog — searchable — with a
  bond-aware Finder margin via `bondMarginOpts`; AP4 `desirabilityOf` computes the Finder's shared
  rank + Desirability grade off `js/estimators.mjs`+`js/rating.mjs`), `trends.js` (archive + seasonal analysis +
  regime/patient/backtest — renders the Trends view; pure analytics live in
  `trendcore.js`; TV — also renders the **Diurnal timing** section via the shared
  `windowread.mjs` `hourProfile`/`deriveDiurnalRange` + a `chartlib.js` bar chart + an
  inform-only `validate.mjs` `reachValidator` note — the same computation the console prints), `trendcore.js` (TC1 — pure DOM-free Trends analytics:
  hourly/seasonal decomposition, the walk-forward `backtestPlan` gate, `patientTargets`
  offer sizing, `bestWindow`/`median`; moved out of `trends.js` for
  `pipeline/trendcore.test.mjs`), `quotecore.js` (DOM-free quote model + canonical
  market-table cells — `computeQuote`/`regimeDrift`/`quoteCells`; shared byte-for-byte
  with the node analysis scripts; also home to `recentDirection` (DP1) and `flushSignal` (DL2 — the
  reactive liquid-flush firing read, consumed ONLY by `pipeline/watch.mjs --dip`, no app import);
  also the ONE type-7 quantile/median home (SF-1):
  `quantileSorted` (pre-sorted input) + `quantileOf`/`median` (sort a copy) — `termstructure.mjs`
  re-exports it as `quantile`, `retrojoin.mjs` aliases `quantileOf`), `windowread.mjs` (P2 — pure window-range/reach math:
  `windowStats`/`quantLow`/`quantHigh`/`touchedDays`/`reachedDays` + the RC1
  `recencySplit`/`recentQuant` reach-contamination guard + the **hour-of-day diurnal profile**
  `hourProfile`/`deriveDiurnalRange` (2026-07-09 — de-trended per-hour dip/peak detection, side-specific
  clustering, and the stale-to-live guard; the peak-timing engine `screen.mjs` auto-runs and
  `windowrange --profile` prints); MOVED here from `pipeline/lib/`
  so it is node- AND app-importable like `quotecore.js`; consumed by `pipeline/windowrange.mjs`,
  `pipeline/watch.mjs`, `pipeline/screen.mjs`, `js/validate.mjs` and `js/forecast.mjs` (both now app-imported via `js/trends.js`, TV).
  PF1 (2026-07-10) added additive per-hour dispersion fields `devMid`/`devLowSpread`/`devHiSpread` (IQR of
  the deviation samples) so the forecast band isn't re-derived; every pre-existing field is byte-identical),
  `forecast.mjs` (PF1 2026-07-10 — the pure forward 12h/24h price projection: **CONSUMES** an `hourProfile`
  object and produces a diurnal+trend forecast — `diurnalForecast(profile, ctx)` → `nextTrough`/`nextPeak`
  `{level, band, etaH, window, confidence, mode}` + the per-hour projected `series`, plus `whenBuyable`/
  `whenSellable`/`fmtEta`. The interpretable ADDITIVE model `projLevel(h) ≈ baselineNow + trendPerHour·Δt +
  deTrendedHourShape(h)`; anchor from the live quote, shape/dispersion from up to 14d, trend from the
  recent slope. DEGRADES LOUDLY to `{forecast:null, reason}` on a spike/decay phase, a live band violation,
  a thin/short series, an unreliable quote, or a trend-erased dip (trend-only mode); the band widens with
  horizon. Claims ONLY "recurring diurnal shape + dumb trend extension" — never an exogenous shock. Imports
  only `windowread.mjs` (no quotecore — `phase`/`mom`/`reliable` arrive as plain ctx). INFORM-ONLY /
  console-only / provisional (n≈0, every constant a NAMED PLACEHOLDER pending the PF8 backtest); no consumer
  wired yet (PF2–PF8) and no app import → no APP_VERSION. Pinned by `pipeline/forecast.test.mjs`),
  `validate.mjs` (P2 — the pure VALIDATOR REGISTRY `(ctx)→{status:pass|caution|reject,reason,evidence}`
  run on EVERY surface: `reachValidator` wraps windowread reach + RC1 into caution/reject WITH the
  reach evidence; `floorValidator` (P3, BUY-side) rejects/cautions a buy parked above the durable floor;
  `trajectoryValidator` (TV1 2026-07-09, BUY-side) is the SHAPE policy over `termstructure`'s
  `classifyTrajectory` — knife/oscillating/based/elevated; `valueAmplitudeValidator` (TV1) the recent-week
  amplitude+proximity for value; `limitValidator` (LM1) the rolling-4h buy-limit; `dipPostureValidator`
  (DP1, BUY-side, INFORM-only/NEVER-REJECT) the dip DIRECTION read via `quotecore.js`'s `recentDirection`
  (a reverting dip → caution "cross or pass"; wired inform on band/churn). All degrade to pass on
  missing data and never throw. `runValidators(ctx,{specs})` drives a PER-THESIS plan (`{key,mode,window}`
  from `js/strategies.mjs`) — `gate` (verdict stands) vs `inform` (`informFlags`: annotate-only, clamped to
  pass, would-have verdict logged via `leanValidators`). `worstStatus`/`flags`. Screens DROP reject + FLAG
  caution + SHOW inform notes; explicit asks/held/watchlist never hidden. NOT app-imported → no APP_VERSION),
  `termstructure.mjs` (P3 — pure DOM-free multi-day term structure over a daily-mid `[{ts,mid}]` series:
  the 1/3/7/14/28d `termStructure` (median/low/high/pctInRange per lookback), a durable **floor** (low
  quantile of the longest multi-week lookback), a robust **ceiling** (P5 — the symmetric high quantile
  q85, so a lone spike can't inflate a range), a **typical fluctuation** (IQR), and a **trajectory** SHAPE
  (TV1 — `classifyTrajectory`: knife/oscillating/based/rising/elevated/flat, attached as `ts.trajectory`);
  degrades to `hasData:false`/`unknown` on a short series. Consumed by `js/validate.mjs`'s floor+trajectory
  validators + `pipeline/screen.mjs`/`pipeline/quote.mjs` + `js/valuescreen.mjs`; here in `js/` so validate.mjs can import it — NOT yet app-imported),
  `valuescreen.mjs` (P5 — the PURE, DOM-free gate/rank/tier math for the `--mode value` buy-hold niche:
  `valueRanges` (recency-anchored shape features) / `valueScore` (composite rank with a deployable-capital
  multiplier; `capGp` threaded from `screen.mjs --capital÷--slots`) / `valueGate` (amplitude floor +
  artifact-low guard + knife guard + coverage guard) / `valueTier` (buy-now vs watch). Consumed by
  `screen.mjs`/`gatecandidates.mjs`; imports only `tax`. Full spec + all NAMED-PLACEHOLDER thresholds (n≈0)
  live in the module header; resolved rank-metric history in `docs/LORE.md`. NOT app-imported → no
  APP_VERSION. Fixture-pinned `pipeline/valuescreen.test.mjs`),
  `paths.mjs` (P4a — the PURE, dependency-free PATH ENGINE core: `enumeratePaths(ctx)→Path[]`
  (candidate thesis-paths for an item — held lots get hold-recovery/value-hold/be-escape/
  list-to-clear/cut; unheld candidates get scalp/value-hold/avoid) + `weighPaths(paths,ctx)→
  {dominant,weighed,enteredUnder,migration}` (viability-weighted ordering off PLACEHOLDER heuristics
  over the derived ctx — regime/phase/underwater/aboveFloor/band-width; `no-data` evidence notes,
  degrade-not-throw). Path = `{key,thesis,action,levels,tripwire,horizon,economics,viability,evidence}`.
  Consumes the enriched ItemContext; recomputes no prices. Alternatives are decision SUPPORT, never
  alert inputs; `migration` here is the RAW instantaneous flag — the persistence-gated
  dominance/migration (arm-then-confirm + hysteresis) SHIPPED at P4b as `pathPersistence`
  (`pipeline/lib/watchstate.mjs`) + `pathsStage` (`pipeline/lib/context.mjs`). NOT yet app-imported →
  no APP_VERSION bump. Fixture-pinned `pipeline/paths.test.mjs`),
  `strategies.mjs` (P4c/P5 — the PURE, DOM-free DECLARATIVE STRATEGY REGISTRY: the screen's FOUR niches
  (band/churn + scalp/value; the `spread` and `rising` specs were DELETED in Steps 3+4) as data-shaped
  specs `{key,label,inAll,pool:{risingFloor},edge,rank,confirm,falling,gate,validators,defaultPath}`.
  `pipeline/lib/gatecandidates.mjs` looks up
  `STRATEGIES[mode]` and calls `spec.edge(...)` / reads `spec.pool.risingFloor` / `spec.rank` / `spec.falling`
  / `spec.gate` instead of branching on the niche name — so a niche can be added or REMOVED by editing the
  registry alone. P5's per-spec `falling` doctrine (`exclude`|`accept`|`knife-guard`), a `gate` selector
  (`band`|`value` — value routes to the term-structure `valueGate`), and the `scalp`/`value` specs (both
  off-by-default). Steps 3+4: `pool.risingFloor` is now vestigial (all false — the rising niche that set it
  true is deleted) and `rank:'proxy'` is unused (rising's proxy ordering is absorbed into `rankAndSlice`'s
  rising reserve). `defaultPath` = the inferred DEFAULT ENTRY PATH the surfacing implies (band/churn/
  scalp → `scalp`, value → `value-hold` — a Ben-vetoable judgment proposal), written to
  `suggestions.jsonl` (lean `path` field) + shown as the screen's per-row entry-path annotation.
  `validateStrategySpec` + `pipeline/strategies.test.mjs` are the CONFORMANCE suite (structural contract +
  no-throw + determinism over the replay archetypes). Imports only `tax` from format.js + `PATH_KEYS` from
  paths.mjs. NOT yet app-imported → no APP_VERSION bump),
  `quote.js` (browser orchestrator that fetches one
  item's series and renders the standard quote table), `fillslog.js` (File System
  Access API writer for `coffer-manual.log` + tombstones), `github.js` (M1 — mobile
  GitHub-as-backend writes: fine-grained PAT in localStorage, `mobile-fills.log` /
  `watchlist.json` via the contents API), `table.js` (TB1 — reusable sortable-table
  helper: click-to-sort headers, direction toggle, arrow decoration, per-table sort
  state persisted under `sort:<name>`; the Finder and Watchlist adopt it), `ui.js`
  (Finder/Watchlist/Coffer/Scan rendering + the `renderAll` coordinator; also stamps
  the published pipeline version + scan time next to the app version — PV),
  `ledger.js` (Ledger view + fills-write cluster — manual-entry writes, positions.json
  auto-populate, Ledger render/controls, freshness + GitHub-sync panels; split out of
  `ui.js` by A3), `ledgercore.js` (TD2 — pure `periodKey`/`groupTrades` day-boundary
  bucketing + per-item grouping, moved out of `ledger.js` so node can import them for
  `pipeline/ledgercore.test.mjs`), `watch.js` (0.49.0 — the Watch tab: a verdict-first
  flipping desk rendering held positions, active offers and today's fills, with verdicts
  from the shared `momVerdict`/`offerVerdict`; per-item session-context notes persist under
  `watchnote:<id>`), `watchcore.js` (0.49.0 — pure Watch-tab derivations: verdict→stripe
  family, alert count, flip/incidental split, today's-fills feed + after-tax net, summary
  aggregates, the YA1 `capitalSplit` working-vs-parked utilization, and the `watch.mjs --brief`
  compact-book format `briefDot`/`briefLine`/`briefBook` — the loop's one-line-per-item report is
  now SCRIPT-owned here, not hand-formatted by the agent; node-importable,
  fixture-tested in `pipeline/watchcore.test.mjs`),
  `backup.js` (export/import),
  `main.js` (entry point — event wiring + init, loaded as `<script type="module">`)
- `manifest.json`, `icon-*.png` — PWA manifest and icons
- `fills.json` — raw real-trade event stream synced from RuneLite; the pipeline source
  `positions.json` is FIFO-reconstructed from (the app fetches the derived `positions.json`,
  not this file directly)
- `mobile-fills.log` — tracked, append-only source log the app appends mobile GE trades to
  (slot 9) via the GitHub contents API; read by `sync-fills.mjs` (M1, `FILLS-PIPELINE.md` §13)
- `positions.json` — derived from `fills.json` by the pipeline (FIFO-matched closed
  trades + open positions); the app auto-populates its Ledger/Coffer from it
- `offers.json` — tracked, flat snapshot of the live GE offer slots (`{slot, side, itemId,
  item, price, qty, filled, lastUpdateTs}`), written by `sync-fills.mjs`/`watch-log.mjs` in
  both attended and `--local` modes (LW1); the localhost app polls it for desk-side offer
  freshness and stashes it on `STATE.offers`, which the **Watch tab** (0.49.0, `js/watch.js`)
  renders as verdict-tagged offer rows (`FILLS-PIPELINE.md` §14). P0: `quote.mjs --positions` also
  reads it (via `lib/offers.mjs`'s `readOffersSnapshot`) as the held-book source for the askFilling
  softening — the OTHER-machine-safe path that needs no local `~/.runelite` log dir
- `.capital-state.json` — **gitignored, local-only, never deployed** — Ben's STATED idle-cash
  balance (`{cashGp, statedAt}`), written by `pipeline/cash.mjs`, read by `watch.mjs`'s SUMMARY
  total-capital line. The GE cash stack is in no log, so idle GP is a stated snapshot: it ages the
  moment a trade happens (staleness-bannered) and is NEVER a verdict/alert input — purely the
  denominator for the idle-vs-working picture
- `heartbeat.json` — **gitignored, local-only, never deployed** — a tiny daemon-liveness
  heartbeat (`{app:'the-coffer-heartbeat', generatedAt:<ISO>}`) written by `watch-log.mjs`
  every ~30s (LW3). The localhost app polls it (`js/ledger.js` `fetchHeartbeat`) for the
  "watcher live" freshness stamp — liveness INDEPENDENT of book changes, because
  `positions.json`'s `generatedAt` only advances on a fill and legitimately freezes during
  quiet no-fill stretches. Does zero git; a stale heartbeat (>90s) is what trips the
  "watcher down?" warning
- `watchlist.json` — tracked repo-root watchlist (array of item names/ids); the app unions it
  with local `STATE.watchlist` and `screen.mjs` always scans it (S3); app writes it back via
  the GitHub contents API (`js/github.js`)
- `alerts.json` — tracked named price alerts (`{itemId, direction, price, note?}`) read by
  `pipeline/alerts.mjs` (N1); ships empty
- `dip-watchlist.json` — tracked repo-root pool of LIQUID flush candidates (array of item
  names/ids, mirrors `watchlist.json`'s shape; ships empty `[]`). Read **only** by
  `pipeline/watch.mjs --dip` (DL2) — NOT app-imported (watchlist.json is the app's, kept separate).
  New candidates appended on discovery (the screen-fed auto-population is the DL2 follow-on).
- `hold-thesis.json` — tracked repo-root store (TG1, 2026-07-07): AGENT-WRITTEN declared hold plans,
  a flat array of `{id, exitPrice, tripwire, horizon, path, enteredUnder, ts}` (`path`/`enteredUnder`
  added additively by P4a — the js/paths.mjs entry-path declaration; legacy entries without them stay
  valid). When Ben declares a patient/accumulation hold ("accumulate nest, exit 4,848, tripwire 4,678,
  multi-day") the agent appends/upserts an entry (the greenlist pattern — hand-edit, `holdthesis.mjs
  upsertThesis`, or `thesis.mjs set … --path <key>` which declares the path/enteredUnder here); a
  14-day TTL prunes stale
  intent. `watch.mjs` reads it READ-ONLY through `pipeline/lib/holdthesis.mjs` and passes it into
  `convictionGate` (`lib/watchstate.mjs`): while the live price holds ABOVE the declared tripwire, the
  EXPECTED-underwater `UNDERWATER`/`CUT-CANDIDATE` headline is silenced to an armed note (being
  underwater vs the instant-clear IS the plan); below the tripwire the real-risk headline fires.
  `momVerdict` is untouched (the verdict stays honest); only the headline is gated. The Gate-2
  breakdown `CUT` is never silenced. Ships empty (`[]`); fixture-pinned in
  `pipeline/lib/holdthesis.test.mjs` + `pipeline/watchstate.test.mjs`.
- `ignored-items.json` — tracked repo-root config (2026-07-07): items QUARANTINED from the MERCH
  book (farming inputs / loot / personal-use — e.g. snapdragon seed 5300, snapdragon 3000). Its
  `items` are dropped from the DERIVED merch views (`positions.json` phantom lots + unmatched-harvest
  sells, `offers.json`, and watch's live-offer rows) while their raw events STAY in `fills.json`
  (full audit — this is a VIEW filter, never a deletion). A `greenlisted` array `[{id,qty,price,ts,
  consumed}]` surfaces a *specific* transaction as a real flip (matched on id + price ±3% + ts ±6h) —
  the agent appends one when Ben confirms a recommended flip of an ignored item (he only flips these
  on a rec, so every legit flip passes that gate). Read + matched by `pipeline/lib/ignored.mjs`,
  applied in `sync-fills.mjs` (positions/offers derivation) and `lib/offers.mjs activeOffers` (watch);
  fixture-pinned in `pipeline/ignored.test.mjs`.
- `suggestions.jsonl` — tracked, append-only suggestions ledger (O1): every emitted
  recommendation, one JSON object per line, written by `quote.mjs`/`screen.mjs`/`watch.mjs`
  via `pipeline/lib/suggestlog.mjs`. Rows carry a lean **`volSrc`** tag (SF-3, `'bulk'`|`'peritem'`)
  recording which `/24h` endpoint the liquidity `class` volume came from (screen = bulk; quote = bulk
  when `all24h.json` was warm, else per-item) so F1 can normalize the two snapshot sources.
  **Bounded to the CURRENT month (SR1):** on append,
  `logSuggestions` rolls any completed month out to a monthly archive (see below), so the
  root file never grows past ~a month of rows. F1-gating accrual is preserved — history is
  archived, never deleted.
- `pipeline/suggestions-archive/` — tracked dir of completed-month archive files
  `suggestions-YYYY-MM.jsonl` (SR1), moved OUT of the deploy root by `rotateLedger`
  (`pipeline/lib/suggestlog.mjs`). Same schema/lines as the active ledger; the append-only O1
  calibration history. Read together with the active file via `readSuggestionLines` — any full-
  history reader (`outcomes.mjs`'s F1 join, `retrojoin.mjs`'s P6a suggestion→fill join) MUST use
  that helper, not the active file alone.
  Created lazily on the first rotation (empty until a month completes); committed by
  `sync-fills.mjs` alongside `suggestions.jsonl`.
- `screen.json` — the published opportunity screen the app's Scan tab renders (written by
  `screen.mjs --publish`)
- `docs/` — repo docs that aren't app/pipeline reference:
  - `PLANNING.md` — the planning process itself (required plan sections, chunk design rules, the
    skills improvement loop, anti-patterns; written 2026-07-08, follow it when producing any
    improvement plan).
  - `LORE.md` (P7) — narrative/history + superseded-approach rationale (the single-file→split
    story, the LW2/LW3 live desk, the pipeline's eliminated scheduler, the incident anchors behind
    the process rules, the rejected/retired approaches). Nothing here is load-bearing — CLAUDE.md
    "Where shipped work is documented" points here for the stories; invariants stay in module headers.
  - `SKILL-TRIAGE.md` (P7) — the three-way triage (ENCODE / KEEP-AS-JUDGMENT / RETIRE-proposal) of
    every prose rule-block in the four market skills + the memory index. The semantic record behind
    the `pipeline/skill-lint.mjs` tags; hand-maintained — add a row when a skill gains a rule.
- `.gitattributes` — repo EOL normalization (GA1): text sources (`*.js`/`*.mjs`/`*.json`/
  `*.jsonl`/`*.md`/`*.yml`/`*.css`/`*.html`/`*.log` + `.gitignore`/`LICENSE`) are `text eol=lf`,
  the Windows batch launchers (`serve.cmd`/`watch-log.cmd`/`*.cmd`) are `text eol=crlf`, and
  `*.png` is `binary`. Makes line endings explicit instead of per-machine `core.autocrlf`
  guessing — that guessing is what emitted the recurring Windows "LF will be replaced by CRLF"
  warnings on commits touching `suggestions.jsonl`/`pipeline/.guide-history.jsonl`/`PLAN.md`
- `pipeline/` — RuneLite fill-data pipeline + node analysis scripts; not served by
  Pages, not part of the app. **CLI entrypoints live directly in `pipeline/`; the
  imported-only libraries they share live in `pipeline/lib/`** (OR2 — the split makes the
  CLI-vs-lib distinction structural, since the exec bit doesn't):
  - **CLI entrypoints (`pipeline/*.mjs`, run directly):** `sync-fills.mjs` (parse logs →
    `fills.json`/`positions.json`/`offers.json`, commit + push; `--local` writes them with
    **zero git** for desk-side freshness — LW1, exported `regenerate()` core),
    `watch-log.mjs` (LW1 local daemon — `fs.watch` the exchange-logger dir + `regenerate()`
    in-process on every change, ~10s debounce, **zero git**; also writes a liveness
    `heartbeat.json` at the repo root every ~30s (LW3, zero git) so the localhost stamp shows
    "watcher live" independent of book changes; started manually via
    `watch-log.cmd`, dies with the terminal — see `FILLS-PIPELINE.md` §14),
    `add-manual-fill.mjs` (inject/tombstone
    manual fills), `quote.mjs` (per-item / `--positions` market table; PM1 stdout-only `Probes`
    column when a probe fires. `--positions` builds the shared `context.mjs` chain per lot — offers.json
    book, read-only watch-state + hold thesis, the shared `renderHeldVerdict`, and a read-only `pathsStage`
    `Paths` block — so it can't disagree with watch.mjs; behavior detail in CLAUDE.md "Script facts"), `screen.mjs`
    (opportunity screen; YP2 adds a stdout-only "WATCH CLOSELY" transition list; PM1 a stdout-only
    `Probes` column per niche; P6c re-runs an empty niche beneath the floor (`subFloorFallback` in
    `lib/gatecandidates.mjs`, honestly labeled + grade-capped + stdout-only, never in `screen.json`; the
    two-sided gate and thesis edge are never relaxed)),
    `watch.mjs` (adaptive live position/offer monitor — the V1–V6 cross-pass memory surface: per-pass
    Δ/structural-support lines (`lib/watchstate.mjs`/`levels.mjs`, persisting `.cache/watch-state.json`),
    the V5 EMIT-CONTRACT note block (`lib/emit.mjs`), and the shared held-verdict + dominant-path lines
    (`renderHeldVerdict`/`pathsStage`, `lib/context.mjs`). The ONE WRITER of the watch-state path fields
    and of `.guide-history.jsonl`; each pass appends the passive Tier-1 archive snapshot. Full output
    contract: `pipeline/MONITORING.md`),
    `monitor.mjs`
    (live read-only log-state snapshot; ARCH-1 — its in-memory held book now applies coffer-manual.log
    REMOVE tombstones via `reconstruct.buildTombstonedEvents`, the same purge sync/positions.json honor,
    so a corrected/mobile lot never reappears as a phantom hold), `thesis.mjs` (YT1 #4 — CLI to set/clear/list the SESSION
    THESIS per item, the sole writer of gitignored `.cache/session-thesis.json`; watch.mjs reads it
    to print a per-held reminder. **P4a** — `set … --path <key> [--entered-under <key>]` ALSO declares
    the path-engine entry path into the TRACKED root `hold-thesis.json` via `holdthesis.upsertThesis`,
    preserving any existing plan fields; enteredUnder defaults to the path on first declaration),
    `cash.mjs` (CLI to set/read/clear the STATED idle-cash balance

    per-path outcome accounting — filled / filled-worse / not-taken counts, realized TTF median/
    spread, and realized profit per unit of attention — over EVERY suggestion row × `fills.json`
    buy offers. The SUGGESTION-keyed FORWARD counterpart to outcomes.mjs's campaign-keyed backward
    join; the ground-truth TTF calibrator for P6 and the input to the band/churn
    consolidation question (the spread/rising niches were deleted in Steps 3+4). Join logic is the pure `lib/retrojoin.mjs`; `--json` dumps raw rows.

    now **APP-IMPORTED by `js/market.js`** (AP4, 0.61.0 — the Finder Grade column + Rating bar + sort use
    the shared `estimateRank` + `rateItem`, replacing the old `RATE_W` profit/hr Risk model; coarse
    live-quick basis in the Finder — the per-item quote is the band-precise read); `pipeline/lib/`
    keeps a one-line re-export shim at each old path so every node importer resolves byte-identically.
    Their descriptions (retained here for the pipeline reader): `rating.mjs` (grade/score model — P6b:
    the reward basis is the per-thesis RANK
    `net × P(fill) ÷ TTF` from `estimators.mjs`, NOT the demoted expGpDay; cutoffs are on that rank
    scale, still PLACEHOLDERS), `estimators.mjs` (P6b — the PURE per-thesis P(fill)+TTF estimators +
    the `rankScore` composite that REPLACED expGpDay as the displayed/graded metric (Ben 2026-07-09:
    "gp/d is out"). Families keyed by a spec's `estimator` field — `intraday` (band/scalp: P(fill) from
    band-depth / a real windowread reach when fetched, TTF from volume velocity), `churn` (Step 6,
    decision A — reuses intraday P(fill)/TTF but ranks the LAP via `churnLapUnits` = min(limit, feasible
    depth), so estimateRank multiplies net × lapUnits: on buy-limit-cycle commodities we always max the
    limit), `value` (P(fill)=floor-proximity, TTF=trough→recovery prior), and `rising` (regime/forecast
    horizon — retained but no shipped spec uses it since the rising niche was deleted, Steps 3+4);
    each estimate is `{value,n,basis}` so the honesty travels with the number. `quotedPair(spec,row)`
    is the ONE price pair the thesis posts (the price-basis principle); `estimateRank(spec,row,extra)`
    bundles pair/net/pFill/ttf/rank. ALL constants are NAMED PLACEHOLDERS, n≈0 — retrojoin.mjs is the
    calibrator. Consumed by `screen.mjs`+`rating.mjs` and **app-imported by `js/market.js`** (AP4,
    0.61.0 — the Finder desirability rank/grade; a behavior change to it now bumps APP_VERSION),
    `gatecandidates.mjs` (P1 — screen.mjs's PURE
    candidate-selection + survival doctrine, moved out of screen.mjs so it's node-importable +
    fixture-testable with synthetic data: the pre-fetch `gateCandidates` gate stack + the

    fetch-pool ranker `rankAndSlice` + `proxyDrift` + `softFactor` (+ `expUnits`) + the **rising reserve**
    (Steps 3+4 — front-loads the highest-proxy risers, the absorbed `rising` niche mechanism), and the
    extracted post-fetch `surviveMode(mode,row,phase,opts)` — falling doctrine/`--phase-rescue`/the
    scalp falling-confirm (+ a vestigial rising-confirm)/overnight-posture, returning
    `{keep,discardReason,rescued}` that maps 1:1 onto renderMode's `disc` counters. **P5**:
    `surviveMode` reads the PER-SPEC `spec.falling` (band/churn keep `exclude`; scalp `accept`s AND
    requires fallers), and `gateCandidates` routes a `gate:'value'` spec to `gateValueCandidates` (the
    term-structure value gate off `ctx.daily` + `js/valuescreen.mjs`) with `rankAndSlice` hard-top-N'ing
    the value pool by `valueScore`), `replay.mjs` (P1 — the
    snapshot-replay acceptance ENGINE: `buildSnapshot()` expands five synthetic ARCHETYPES into a full

    it also carries v24/band/latest/timeseries/daily so the whole funnel runs offline) anchored to a
    fixed `ANCHOR_TS`; `runReplay(snapshot,opts)` drives the WHOLE per-niche funnel — `gateCandidates`
    → `rankAndSlice` → `computeQuote`/`phase` → `surviveMode` — and returns the per-niche stage

    reunites active+archives for full-history readers; YS2 `suggestionEntry` also lean-includes the
    forward prediction fields — `posture` and the plumbing for `tripwire`/`fillWindowHrs`/`velocityClass`/`thesis` —
    written only when a caller honestly supplies them, so legacy rows stay byte-identical; P2 also
    lean-includes a `validators` flag list; SF-3's `classAndSource(row,id,warmBulkMap)` picks the logged
    liquidity `class` + the lean `volSrc` (`bulk`|`peritem`) tag, converging quote on screen's bulk
    `/24h` snapshot when it's warm), `version.mjs` (PV — the ONE `PIPELINE_VERSION` const, stamped
    into `screen.json` (`pipeline` field) + `positions.json` so the app can display the pipeline
    version beside APP_VERSION; independent bump track, launched at 1.0.0 with the app parity milestone),
    `retrojoin.mjs` (P6a — the PURE, fixture-tested join
    core behind `pipeline/retrojoin.mjs`: `retroJoin(suggestions, fillsEvents)` classifies each
    suggestion row's forward outcome (filled / filled-worse / not-taken), measures suggestion→fill
    latency + the FIFO-matched round-trip (realized net / hold time, reusing reconstruct.mjs's
    helpers — never re-implemented), with a NEAREST-PRIOR one-fill-one-suggestion dedup rule; and
    `aggregateOutcomes(rows)` groups per niche + per path with n on every field. NAMED-placeholder
    per-mode horizons; no fs/fetch — caller feeds parsed rows). **`windowread.mjs` MOVED to `js/`** (P2 — see the `js/`
    inventory above; consumed here by `windowrange.mjs`/`watch.mjs`),
    `watchstate.mjs` (V1/V4/V7 — PURE cross-pass temporal memory for the watch loop: `computeDeltas`/
    `advanceState` compute Δ instabuy, mom transitions, `passesUnderwater`/`passesBelowSupport` counters
    (display), the `underwaterSince`/`belowSupportSince`/`breakdownSince` streak timestamps, and band-top
    drift, with a reset policy on identity change / `STALE_GAP_MS`; plus the `convictionGate()` — the pure
    arm-then-confirm ALERT-escalation decision, now **TIME-based (V7, `ALERT_PERSIST_MS`)** so alert
    sensitivity is independent of loop cadence (Gate-2 breakdown CUT exempt/immediate; Gate-D
    CUT-CANDIDATE, structural break, AND `LIST-TO-CLEAR` gated on elapsed persistence). **P4b** adds
    `pathPersistence()` — the SAME arm-then-confirm discipline applied to PATH DOMINANCE: a dominance
    flip must beat the incumbent by `PATH_HYSTERESIS_MARGIN` and hold for `PATH_PERSIST_MS` (both
    named placeholders) before the persisted `currentPath` changes; a flip-back disarms, so flapping
    weights never whiplash the headline path. State entries grow the ADDITIVE `currentPath`/
    `pathArmedKey`/`pathArmedSince`/`enteredUnder` fields (legacy entries stay byte-identical —
    fixture-pinned in `pathpersist.test.mjs`).
    Thin `loadState`/`saveState` are the only fs surface — verdict strings untouched, `momVerdict`
    untouched), `levels.mjs`

    sell/list-at (+ break-even) · fill-progress`, with the sell line GUARANTEED on every held lot;
    orders/formats already-computed pieces, decides nothing — output-format-only),
    `recovery.mjs` (V6 — PURE `recoveryRead`/`recoveryLine`/`recoveryTrigger`: the ADVISORY
    recover-vs-drop LEAN that COMPOSES momVerdict's existing signals (diurnal · regime/phase ·
    underwater-persistence · vs structural support) + the trigger gating that surfaces it only on a
    non-clean position — decides NOTHING, never a verdict/alert input; a `spike` caps confidence),
    `capital.mjs` (V6 Companion — PURE `freedCapital`: detects capital freed by a booked SELL between
    passes off V1's prior-pass state and prompts a redeploy scan ≥ `FREED_CAPITAL_SCAN_GP` — surface-

    rising-vs-falling lows for the screen's "watch closely" list; descriptive, never a buy signal),
    `velocitytag.mjs` (Build 2 — PURE `buildVelocityIndex`/`velocityTag` over the gitignored
    outcomes.json campaigns: per-item dominant velocity + median time-to-first-fill + % of bids that
    never filled, for screen.mjs's stdout velocity footnote; a label off history, never a rate/gate),
    `guideanchor.mjs` (YP1 #2 — PURE guide re-anchor model off `.guide-history.jsonl`: modal update
    hour + median step, HONESTY-GATED below `GUIDE_MIN_UPDATES` (ships silent today — the wild history
    is all baselines); advisory line on quote/watch, never a verdict input),
    `sessionthesis.mjs` (YT1 #4 — PURE session-thesis state model: `loadThesis`/`saveThesis`/`upsert`/
    `clear`/`prune`/`thesisLine`, the intent-per-lane store watch.mjs reads read-only; persists like
    watchstate),
    `holdthesis.mjs` (TG1 — PURE declared-hold-thesis store: `loadHoldThesis`/`saveHoldThesis`/
    `thesisFor`/`upsertThesis`/`clearThesis`/`pruneHoldThesis` over the TRACKED root `hold-thesis.json`
    array of `{id,exitPrice,tripwire,horizon,path,enteredUnder,ts}` — **P4a** grew the additive optional
    `path`/`enteredUnder` (the js/paths.mjs entry-path declaration; LEGACY entries without them stay
    fully valid, both default null); watch.mjs reads it read-only and feeds it to `convictionGate` to
    SILENCE the expected-underwater headline while live holds above the declared tripwire — never
    touches `momVerdict`; fixture-pinned `holdthesis.test.mjs`),
    `context.mjs` (P0 — the ITEM CONTEXT CHAIN + the ONE shared held-verdict renderer, the home that ENDS
    the quote-vs-watch verdict fork: staged PURE enrichers (identity→market→history→intraday→position)
    build an `ItemContext`; `renderHeldVerdict(ctx,{mode})` emits the compact (quote `--positions`) or
    verbose (watch heldAction) form off ONE `heldMomVerdict`, byte-identical to the pre-P0 inline
    functions, so the two surfaces can't disagree. **P4b** adds `pathsStage` + `renderPathLine` (the
    shared dominant-path line, ADDITIVE watch-state fields); **COD-4** adds `staleBookBanner` (the
    positions.json-age warning both surfaces now share). No fetch/fs — every stage is node-importable +
    fixture-pinned in `context.test.mjs`), `richterm.mjs` (COD-4 — `richFrom1h`/
    `trajectoryFrom1h`: aggregate a fetched 1h /timeseries into a WARM multi-week term structure so
    reach/trajectory FIRE while the `loadDaily` archive is still young; EXTRACTED from screen.mjs so
    `quote.mjs`'s budgeted-`ts1h` read shares the identical aggregation — one home, no drift), `histstate.mjs` (YF1 — reconstruct MARKET STATE AS OF a past timestamp: the PURE `deriveState`

    honesty when the history is gone; the shared seam #1(a)'s every-fill classification + #2's
    state-transition scan both read — no market math re-implemented),
    `modules.mjs` (PM1 — the probe-module LOADER + stage-keyed runner: auto-discovers
    `pipeline/modules/*.mjs`, groups by stage (`observe`/`price`/`gate`), and `runProbes(row,surface,ctx)`
    returns the fired display annotations. **Presence = enabled** (delete the file to disable). The
    **empty-passthrough guarantee** — no module present or none fire ⇒ `[]` ⇒ nothing appends ⇒
    byte-identical output — is the removability contract. `collectNeeds` exposes the multi-item
    `needs(row,ctx)` sibling-id declaration (decant). NO probe of any stage feeds a
    verdict/gate/rating/reconstruction — observe probes touch no number, price probes touch only the
    advisory recommendation. `logFirings(fired,meta)` (PM2) appends the fired annotations to
    `pipeline/modules/<module>.log` — called by each surface AFTER the PURE runProbes; failure-safe)
  - **Probe modules (`pipeline/modules/*.mjs`, PM1 — experimental per-item theory plug-ins):** each a
    pure `{name,version,theory,stage,surfaces,needs?,probe}` file, trial-and-keep-or-drop, surfaced in

    lower dose whose per-4-dose cost beats the 4-dose; declares its siblings via `needs()`; screen-only,
    since the per-item quote surface has no whole-market map). The gitignored `pipeline/modules/<name>.log`
    firing log is now WIRED (PM2): `logFirings` appends one compact JSONL line per firing —

    and the removed per-niche mode flags — see the `DENYLIST` table in the source for the exact patterns)
    — a ruling that deletes a concept adds a line, CI then catches every future doc
    that resurrects it; an `xfail` records a KNOWN live violation owned elsewhere (index.html's stale

    (2) a **single-source / duplicate-phrase** check that flags a distinctive 14-word shingle appearing
    verbatim in >1 doc on the CLAUDE.md ⇆ README.md axis (the copy-not-move failure), with a `DUP_ALLOWLIST`
    for legit shared boilerplate + known pre-existing dups owned by DOC-2/DOC-3. **MUST stay a
    denylist + structural checker — never a semantic/LLM checker** (the skill-lint honesty note applies
    verbatim: it catches recurrence of NAMED drift + novel COPY, NOT novel contradiction; the wave-start

    — all auto-discovered by
    `run-tests.mjs` (below), which CI runs once
  - `pipeline/fixtures/replay/snapshot.json` + `golden.json` (**tracked**, P1) — the committed inputs +
    expected outputs for `replay.test.mjs`. `snapshot.json` is a `coffer-replay-snapshot/1` synthetic
    market state (five archetypes — stable band, genuine dip, thin big ticket, decay-knife, falling
    wide-band; no PII, no live data), produced by `lib/replay.mjs` `buildSnapshot()`; `golden.json`
    (`coffer-replay-golden/1`) is the per-niche funnel result `runReplay` must reproduce. Regenerate
    both with `node pipeline/replay.test.mjs --update` (hand-review the diff). Consumer: `replay.test.mjs`.
  - gitignored scratch is consolidated under `pipeline/.cache/` (OR2): the market caches plus
    `mapping.cache.json`, `.alerts-state.json`, the optional `held-override.json`, the FC1
    `fetch/` per-URL cache (opt-in cross-invocation fetch cache — one `{ts,url,data}` file per
    cached GET, disposable), the YF1 `outcomes-daily/` per-item reduced past 1h@6h series (sibling
    of `outcomes-bands/`), the YT1 `session-thesis.json` (intent-per-lane store; `thesis.mjs` writes,
    watch.mjs reads), the COD-3 `last-weekly-report` stamp (an ISO timestamp `outcomes.mjs --report` writes
    and `--weekly-due` reads — the `/morning` weekly-read cadence memory), and
    `watch-state.json` (V1 — the watch loop's cross-pass memory: a keyed map
    `held:<id>`/`bid:<id>:<offer>` → `{ts, identity, instabuy, mom, bandTop, breakEven, support,
    underwater, passesUnderwater, belowSupport, passesBelowSupport, bandTopHist[]}`, rewritten fresh
    each pass by `watch.mjs` so vanished positions drop out; counters reset on identity change or a
    gap > `STALE_GAP_MS`. Local, disposable —
    deleting it just loses one pass of delta history)
  - `pipeline/.guide-history.jsonl` (**tracked** as of 2026-07-06 — Ben's call: it's an accruing
    observation record, so it lives in the repo to survive a lost machine; kept OUTSIDE `.cache/`
    so cache pruning never touches it) — change-only GE guide-price observations for watched items,
    one JSON line `{ts,id,name,guide,prev}` per observed change, appended by `watch.mjs`
    `logGuideChanges()` at watch cadence. Purpose: pin each item's ~daily guide-update
    time + magnitude to feed the guide-re-anchor pricing edge (PLAN.md Discovered,
    2026-07-06). Consumer: `pipeline/lib/guideanchor.mjs` (YP1 — the guide re-anchor model, honesty-gated
    on accrual; quote.mjs/watch.mjs surface its advisory line, silent until enough real updates accrue). (Not auto-committed by
    `sync-fills.mjs`; commit it periodically so the record on `origin` stays current.)
  - `pipeline/.market-archive.sqlite` (+ `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars) — **gitignored, machine-local, D0**:
    the Tier-1 SQLite market archive. Append-forever RAW `/1h`+`/5m` whole-market observations
    (~30–35GB/yr, Ben-approved) that the wiki API only serves ~30h/item live — the ONLY route to broad
    intraday history, feeding P3's term structure + P6's backtests. Deliberately OUTSIDE `pipeline/.cache/`
    (that tree is disposable/pruned; the archive must survive). Producer: `pipeline/lib/archive.mjs`
    (`append`, via `loadDaily`/`loadSnapshot`). Consumers: `loadDaily`'s regime proxy + P3's
    `js/termstructure.mjs` durable-floor read (via `loadDaily`, incl. the read-only `{noFetch:true}` path
    quote.mjs uses); the Pipeline-v2 context chain (P0+) as it lands. NEVER committed (huge, machine-local,
    reproducible-by-accrual).
  - `FILLS-PIPELINE.md` (pipeline design + operations) and `MONITORING.md` (live-monitoring
    routine). The `quote.mjs`/`screen.mjs`/`watch.mjs` scripts import `js/quotecore.js` +
    `js/format.js` so their tables match the app exactly.

## Map of the repo

Two things bite when you move or edit a file here, so they get their own map: the root
**data artifacts** (some are load-bearing at fixed paths; some are free to move) and the
two **shared logic modules** that are served to the browser *and* imported by node.

### Root data artifacts

**ROOT-LOCKED** — the app fetches these same-origin and/or the deployed phone writes them at
hardcoded contents-API paths, so moving any one is a coordinated app + pipeline +
deployed-phone change (not a rename):

| File | What locks it to the root |
| --- | --- |
| `positions.json` | app fetches same-origin (`js/ledger.js` `syncFills`) |
| `offers.json` | app fetches same-origin on localhost (`js/ledger.js` `fetchOffers`, LW2) — live GE offer snapshot written by `sync-fills.mjs`/`watch-log.mjs` |
| `screen.json` | app fetches same-origin (`js/ui.js` Scan tab) |
| `watchlist.json` | app fetches same-origin (`js/ui.js`) **and** the phone writes it back via the contents API (`js/github.js` `WATCHLIST_PATH`) |
| `mobile-fills.log` | the phone appends slot-9 lines via the contents API (`js/github.js` `MOBILE_LOG_PATH`); `sync-fills.mjs` reads it |
| `fills.json` | the pipeline source `positions.json` is FIFO-reconstructed from; `sync-fills.mjs` commits it at the root (not app-fetched directly, but coupled to the same convention) |

**Pipeline-only / movable** — no app fetch and no hardcoded remote path; a single path
constant governs each, so these can move without touching the deployed app or phone:

| File | Producer / consumer | Tracked? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `alerts.json` | read by `pipeline/alerts.mjs` (N1) | tracked (ships empty) |
| `suggestions.jsonl` | appended by `pipeline/lib/suggestlog.mjs` (O1 fields + YS2 forward `posture?`/… + SF-3 `volSrc?`); SR1-bounded to the current month | tracked, append-only |
| `pipeline/suggestions-archive/suggestions-YYYY-MM.jsonl` | completed months rolled out of the active ledger by `rotateLedger` (SR1); read with the active file via `readSuggestionLines` | tracked, append-only (lazy) |
| `outcomes.json` | derived by `pipeline/outcomes.mjs` (F1 join reads active+archives) | gitignored |

### Shared logic modules

`js/quotecore.js` and `js/format.js` are served to the browser **and** imported by node —
an edit ripples into the pipeline scripts and CI, not just the app. After editing either,
run `pipeline/quotecore.test.mjs` + `pipeline/reconstruct.test.mjs`.

| Module | Also imported by (pipeline) |
| --- | --- |
| `js/quotecore.js` | 13 files: `quote.mjs`, `screen.mjs`, `watch.mjs`, `monitor.mjs`, `alerts.mjs`, `lib/cli.mjs`, `lib/reconstruct.mjs`, `lib/retrojoin.mjs` (P6a — `tax` for suggested-net; SF-1 — `quantileOf` for the p25/p75 latency spread), `add-manual-fill.mjs`, `quotecore.test.mjs`, `watchcore.test.mjs` (`offerVerdict`, shared with the app Watch tab), `dipposture.test.mjs` (DP1 — `recentDirection`); plus the js/ side-imports `js/termstructure.mjs` (SF-1 — re-exports `quantileSorted` as `quantile`) + `js/validate.mjs` (DP1 — `recentDirection` for `dipPostureValidator`) |
| `js/format.js` | 6 files: `quote.mjs`, `screen.mjs`, `watch.mjs`, `alerts.mjs`, `outcomes.mjs`, `retrojoin.mjs` (P6a — `fmt`/`fmtTurn` for the report); also `js/strategies.mjs` (P4c — `tax` for the spec edges) + `js/estimators.mjs` (P6b — `netMargin`/`clamp` for the rank composite; moved from pipeline/lib 2026-07-10) |
| `js/windowread.mjs` | `pipeline/windowrange.mjs`, `pipeline/watch.mjs`, `pipeline/screen.mjs` (diurnal profile), `js/validate.mjs`, `js/forecast.mjs` (PF1 — consumes `hourProfile`), `pipeline/windowread.test.mjs` (P2 — moved from `pipeline/lib/`); **APP-IMPORTED by `js/trends.js`** (TV — the Trends Diurnal timing section, same `hourProfile`/`deriveDiurnalRange` the console prints) |
| `js/forecast.mjs` | `pipeline/forecast.test.mjs`; **APP-IMPORTED by `js/trends.js`** (TV, 0.60.0 — the Trends "Forward forecast" section: `diurnalForecast`/`fmtEta`, provisional PF n≈0). Console-side consumers still pending — PF2 quote, PF3 screen, PF4 windowrange, PF5 watch/positions, PF6 estimators, PF7 validate. An app-behavior change to it bumps APP_VERSION. |
| `js/validate.mjs` | `pipeline/screen.mjs`, `pipeline/quote.mjs`, `pipeline/validate.test.mjs`, `pipeline/termstructure.test.mjs`, `pipeline/dipposture.test.mjs` (DP1 — `dipPostureValidator`) (P2/P3 — the validator registry: reach + floor + dip-posture); imports `js/quotecore.js` (DP1 — `recentDirection`); **APP-IMPORTED by `js/trends.js`** (TV — `reachValidator` beside the Diurnal timing chart; `floorValidator`+`trajectoryValidator` beside the 0.60.0 term-structure overlay — all inform-only) |
| `js/termstructure.mjs` | `js/validate.mjs`, `pipeline/screen.mjs`, `pipeline/quote.mjs`, `pipeline/termstructure.test.mjs` (P3 — term structure / durable floor); **APP-IMPORTED by `js/trends.js`** (TV, 0.60.0 — the Price-history floor/ceiling overlay). Imports `js/quotecore.js` for the shared `quantileSorted` (SF-1) and re-exports it as `quantile`. |
| `js/paths.mjs` | `pipeline/lib/context.mjs` (`pathsStage`, P4b — so `watch.mjs` + `quote.mjs --positions` at runtime), `js/strategies.mjs` (P4c — `PATH_KEYS` vocabulary), `pipeline/screen.mjs` (P4c — per-row entry-path annotation), `pipeline/paths.test.mjs`, `pipeline/pathpersist.test.mjs` (not yet app-imported) |
| `js/strategies.mjs` | `pipeline/lib/gatecandidates.mjs` (spec-driven gate edge/pool/rank), `pipeline/screen.mjs` (mode-name lists + `defaultPath`; P6b — the per-spec `estimator` family + `priceBasis`), `js/estimators.mjs` (P6b — `estimatorFor(spec)`/`quotedPair(spec,row)` read those two fields; moved from pipeline/lib 2026-07-10), `pipeline/strategies.test.mjs` (P4c/P6b — the declarative niche registry; not yet app-imported) |

### Test-location convention

Tests are `*.test.mjs` files **colocated next to the code they pin** (e.g.
`pipeline/quotecore.test.mjs` sits beside its subject, `pipeline/lib/rating.test.mjs` beside
`pipeline/lib/rating.mjs`) — there is **never** a `tests/` directory; adjacency beats grouping
for agents. Each test is plain `node <file>.test.mjs` (no framework — copy the shape of an
existing one). They are **auto-discovered**: `pipeline/run-tests.mjs` recursively finds every
`pipeline/**/*.test.mjs`, runs each in its own child process, and exits non-zero if any suite
fails **or** if zero suites are found. CI (`.github/workflows/checks.yml`) and `/ship` call the
runner once, so **adding a test file is the whole job** — nothing else wires it in. Follow the
same rule for `js/` and `pipeline/lib/` subjects: put the test beside the file (tests for `js/`
subjects live under `pipeline/`, which is where the runner globs — the `quotecore.test.mjs`/
`format.test.mjs` precedent).

## Local development

ES module scripts can't load over `file://` (browsers block it for CORS reasons),
so double-clicking `index.html` won't work. Run **`serve.cmd`** (tries the `py`
launcher's `http.server`, falls back to `python3`, then `npx serve`) and open
`http://localhost:8000/`. GitHub Pages is unaffected — it always serves over HTTP.

`serve.cmd` is also the **live desk experience** (LW2): it now `start /b`s the
`watch-log.mjs` daemon in the same console (one Ctrl+C stops both, commit `74e437a`), so no
separate `watch-log.cmd` step is needed. On localhost the app polls `positions.json` +
`offers.json` + `heartbeat.json` every ~30s, so with RuneLite running every fill / cancel /
reprice shows up in the local app within ~40s — no keystrokes, **zero git commits**. The
**Watch tab** (0.49.0) is the desk surface over this data: verdict-first held cards, active
offers, today's fills, with a two-part freshness stamp instead of the deployed
Refresh-positions banner — **`watcher live hh:mm`** (from `heartbeat.json`, the real daemon
liveness signal — warns "watcher down?" if >90s stale) **·** `book synced hh:mm` (from
`positions.json`, informational, no age warning since a frozen book is normal when trading is
quiet). This split (LW3) fixed a false "is the watcher running?" alarm the old
positions-only stamp raised during no-fill stretches. On `bensumm.github.io` the poll is off
and the M1 banner + button are unchanged.

Data sources are the OSRS Wiki real-time prices API, the in-game GE guide price
(wiki module + weirdgloop history), all fetched client-side.

## Deploy

`git push` to `main` auto-deploys via GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → deploy from
`main` / root). There is **no service worker**, so there's no cache to invalidate —
the next launch serves the new files. Deploy typically lands within ~1 minute.

## Persistence

State lives in **IndexedDB** (ledger, watchlist, settings, the growing hourly price
archives, cached snapshots), with a `localStorage`/in-memory fallback. Use the in-app
**Export** button periodically as a backstop — browsers can evict site storage under
pressure, even for installed PWAs. Export/Import round-trips the full state as JSON.

## Notes for future work

- A service worker (network-first for the HTML) would add an offline shell, but the
  app needs the live wiki API to be useful, so it was intentionally omitted.
- For an edge-to-edge iOS look: switch `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` to
  `black-translucent`, add `viewport-fit=cover` to the viewport meta, pad the header
  with `env(safe-area-inset-top)`.
