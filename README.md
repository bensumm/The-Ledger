# The Coffer — OSRS Grand Exchange flipping tool

**Live: https://bensumm.github.io/The-Ledger/**

A self-contained web app for finding and managing OSRS Grand Exchange flips. Vanilla
JS, no build step, no framework, no bundler — plain static files served by GitHub
Pages. Installable as a PWA (works on desktop and iOS home screen), but primary
development is now on desktop.

Every price/margin in the app is **after the 2% GE sell tax** (floored per item,
capped at 5m, none under 50gp). Price convention follows flipper usage: **Buy** =
the instasell price (where you place buy offers), **Sell** = the instabuy price.

## What it does

- **Finder** — ranks flippable items by a budget-aware **rating** (profit/hr × a
  quality dampener blending ROI, liquidity, stability, and turnaround; hover the Risk
  grade for the per-factor breakdown). Stability here is a cheap live-price-vs-guide
  proxy — the full regime-drift check lives on the Trends page. Sortable by rating,
  profit/hr, margin, ROI, or volume. Typing a **search** query reveals *every* mapped
  match — including cheap items (soul rune ~300gp) the browse-mode price floor normally
  hides; those search-only rows show `—` for the rating columns and lean on the quote
  button + star.
- **Trends** — deep per-item analysis. A live "Suggested plan" (instant buy/sell +
  **patient pricing** that sizes a wider-margin offer off the recent 2h range),
  a **regime-shift guard** that warns when a recent price-level jump makes the
  hourly-timing stats unreliable, a plain-language guide-divergence readout
  ("Why this trend?"), 3-month price history, and a collapsible **timing &
  seasonality** section gated on a walk-forward backtest (hourly charts only appear
  when the timing edge is actually proven out-of-sample).
- **Watchlist / Signals** — star items to track; live buy signals fire when a
  watched item has an after-tax spread during its historically-cheap window.
- **Ledger** — per-item grouped open/closed positions with after-tax realized/unrealized P/L,
  summarized in the "Coffer" header tiles. Item names link to Trends; multi-lot groups expand via a
  chevron; a "P&L by" Day/Week/Month control on the Closed-flips header drives a period strip whose
  buckets click to filter the table by sell date; the manual-entry form is a collapsible section and the
  closed columns are sortable.
- **Fill-data pipeline** — see `pipeline/` (below): captures real GE trades from
  RuneLite to `fills.json` so the tool can eventually calibrate its predictions
  against actual fills.

## Files

- `index.html` — the app shell (markup only)
- `styles.css` — all styles
- `js/` — app logic as ES modules: `state.js` (shared mutable state as one `STATE`
  object + constants + persistence + diagnostics), `format.js` (formatting/tax —
  the canonical `tax()`/`breakEven()`/`netMargin`/`netMarginQty` helpers), `charts.js`
  (inline SVG), `marketfetch.js` (shared browser fetch layer — one timeout-guarded `jget`
  + one cached `fetchTs`/`fetch24h` store, A2), `market.js`
  (price/guide fetch + scoring), `trends.js` (archive + seasonal analysis +
  regime/patient/backtest — renders the Trends view; pure analytics live in
  `trendcore.js`), `trendcore.js` (TC1 — pure DOM-free Trends analytics:
  hourly/seasonal decomposition, the walk-forward `backtestPlan` gate, `patientTargets`
  offer sizing, `bestWindow`/`median`; moved out of `trends.js` for
  `pipeline/trendcore.test.mjs`), `quotecore.js` (DOM-free quote model + canonical
  market-table cells — `computeQuote`/`regimeDrift`/`quoteCells`; shared byte-for-byte
  with the node analysis scripts), `windowread.mjs` (P2 — pure window-range/reach math:
  `windowStats`/`quantLow`/`quantHigh`/`touchedDays`/`reachedDays` + the RC1
  `recencySplit`/`recentQuant` reach-contamination guard; MOVED here from `pipeline/lib/`
  so it is node- AND app-importable like `quotecore.js`; consumed by `pipeline/windowrange.mjs`,
  `pipeline/watch.mjs` and `js/validate.mjs` — NOT yet app-imported),
  `validate.mjs` (P2 — the pure VALIDATOR REGISTRY `(ctx)→{status:pass|caution|reject,reason,evidence}`
  run on EVERY surface: `reachValidator` wraps windowread reach + RC1 into caution/reject WITH the
  reach evidence, degrades to pass on missing data and never throws; `runValidators`/`worstStatus`/
  `flags`/`leanValidators`. Screens DROP reject + FLAG caution; explicit asks/held/watchlist are never
  hidden. `floorValidator` (P3, BUY-side only) rejects/cautions a buy parked well above the durable
  multi-week floor; a HELD lot degrades. NOT yet app-imported → adding it does not bump APP_VERSION),
  `termstructure.mjs` (P3 — pure DOM-free multi-day term structure over a daily-mid `[{ts,mid}]` series:
  the 1/3/7/14/28d `termStructure` (median/low/high/pctInRange per lookback), a durable **floor** (low
  quantile of the longest multi-week lookback) + a **typical fluctuation** (IQR); degrades to
  `hasData:false` on a short series. Consumed by `js/validate.mjs`'s floorValidator + `pipeline/screen.mjs`/
  `pipeline/quote.mjs`; here in `js/` so validate.mjs can import it — NOT yet app-imported),
  `paths.mjs` (P4a — the PURE, dependency-free PATH ENGINE core: `enumeratePaths(ctx)→Path[]`
  (candidate thesis-paths for an item — held lots get hold-recovery/value-hold/be-escape/
  list-to-clear/cut; unheld candidates get scalp/value-hold/avoid) + `weighPaths(paths,ctx)→
  {dominant,weighed,enteredUnder,migration}` (viability-weighted ordering off PLACEHOLDER heuristics
  over the derived ctx — regime/phase/underwater/aboveFloor/band-width; `no-data` evidence notes,
  degrade-not-throw). Path = `{key,thesis,action,levels,tripwire,horizon,economics,viability,evidence}`.
  Consumes the enriched ItemContext; recomputes no prices. Alternatives are decision SUPPORT, never
  alert inputs; `migration` here is the RAW instantaneous flag — the persistence-gated
  dominance/migration (arm-then-confirm + hysteresis) SHIPPED at P4b as `pathPersistence`
  (`pipeline/lib/watchstate.mjs`) + `pathsStage` (`pipeline/lib/context.mjs`). NOT yet app-imported →
  no APP_VERSION bump. Fixture-pinned `pipeline/paths.test.mjs`),
  `strategies.mjs` (P4c — the PURE, DOM-free DECLARATIVE STRATEGY REGISTRY: the screen's four niches
  (band/spread/rising/churn) as data-shaped specs `{key,label,inAll,pool:{risingFloor},edge,rank,
  confirm,validators,defaultPath}`. `pipeline/lib/gatecandidates.mjs` looks up `STRATEGIES[mode]` and
  calls `spec.edge(...)` / reads `spec.pool.risingFloor` / `spec.rank` instead of branching on the niche
  name — byte-identical to the old inline logic (pinned by the P1 replay goldens), so P5 registers the
  scalp/value specs WITHOUT editing gatecandidates.mjs or screen.mjs again. `defaultPath` = the inferred
  DEFAULT ENTRY PATH the surfacing implies (band/spread/churn → `scalp`, rising → `value-hold` — a
  Ben-vetoable judgment proposal), written to `suggestions.jsonl` (lean `path` field) + shown as the
  screen's per-row entry-path annotation. `validateStrategySpec` + `pipeline/strategies.test.mjs` are the
  CONFORMANCE suite (structural contract + no-throw + determinism over the replay archetypes). Imports
  only `tax` from format.js + `PATH_KEYS` from paths.mjs. NOT yet app-imported → no APP_VERSION bump),
  `quote.js` (browser orchestrator that fetches one
  item's series and renders the standard quote table), `fillslog.js` (File System
  Access API writer for `coffer-manual.log` + tombstones), `github.js` (M1 — mobile
  GitHub-as-backend writes: fine-grained PAT in localStorage, `mobile-fills.log` /
  `watchlist.json` via the contents API), `table.js` (TB1 — reusable sortable-table
  helper: click-to-sort headers, direction toggle, arrow decoration, per-table sort
  state persisted under `sort:<name>`; the Finder and Watchlist adopt it), `ui.js`
  (Finder/Watchlist/Signals/Coffer/Scan rendering + the `renderAll` coordinator),
  `ledger.js` (Ledger view + fills-write cluster — manual-entry writes, positions.json
  auto-populate, Ledger render/controls, freshness + GitHub-sync panels; split out of
  `ui.js` by A3), `ledgercore.js` (TD2 — pure `periodKey`/`groupTrades` day-boundary
  bucketing + per-item grouping, moved out of `ledger.js` so node can import them for
  `pipeline/ledgercore.test.mjs`), `watch.js` (0.49.0 — the Watch tab: a verdict-first
  flipping desk rendering held positions, active offers and today's fills, with verdicts
  from the shared `momVerdict`/`offerVerdict`; per-item session-context notes persist under
  `watchnote:<id>`), `watchcore.js` (0.49.0 — pure Watch-tab derivations: verdict→stripe
  family, alert count, flip/incidental split, today's-fills feed + after-tax net, summary
  aggregates, the YA1 `capitalSplit` working-vs-parked utilization, and the `watch.mjs --brief`
  compact-book format `briefDot`/`briefLine`/`briefBook` — the loop's one-line-per-item report is
  now SCRIPT-owned here, not hand-formatted by the agent; node-importable,
  fixture-tested in `pipeline/watchcore.test.mjs`),
  `backup.js` (export/import),
  `main.js` (entry point — event wiring + init, loaded as `<script type="module">`)
- `manifest.json`, `icon-*.png` — PWA manifest and icons
- `fills.json` — raw real-trade event stream synced from RuneLite; the pipeline source
  `positions.json` is FIFO-reconstructed from (the app fetches the derived `positions.json`,
  not this file directly)
- `mobile-fills.log` — tracked, append-only source log the app appends mobile GE trades to
  (slot 9) via the GitHub contents API; read by `sync-fills.mjs` (M1, `FILLS-PIPELINE.md` §13)
- `positions.json` — derived from `fills.json` by the pipeline (FIFO-matched closed
  trades + open positions); the app auto-populates its Ledger/Coffer from it
- `offers.json` — tracked, flat snapshot of the live GE offer slots (`{slot, side, itemId,
  item, price, qty, filled, lastUpdateTs}`), written by `sync-fills.mjs`/`watch-log.mjs` in
  both attended and `--local` modes (LW1); the localhost app polls it for desk-side offer
  freshness and stashes it on `STATE.offers`, which the **Watch tab** (0.49.0, `js/watch.js`)
  renders as verdict-tagged offer rows (`FILLS-PIPELINE.md` §14). P0: `quote.mjs --positions` also
  reads it (via `lib/offers.mjs`'s `readOffersSnapshot`) as the held-book source for the askFilling
  softening — the OTHER-machine-safe path that needs no local `~/.runelite` log dir
- `.capital-state.json` — **gitignored, local-only, never deployed** — Ben's STATED idle-cash
  balance (`{cashGp, statedAt}`), written by `pipeline/cash.mjs`, read by `watch.mjs`'s SUMMARY
  total-capital line. The GE cash stack is in no log, so idle GP is a stated snapshot: it ages the
  moment a trade happens (staleness-bannered) and is NEVER a verdict/alert input — purely the
  denominator for the idle-vs-working picture
- `heartbeat.json` — **gitignored, local-only, never deployed** — a tiny daemon-liveness
  heartbeat (`{app:'the-coffer-heartbeat', generatedAt:<ISO>}`) written by `watch-log.mjs`
  every ~30s (LW3). The localhost app polls it (`js/ledger.js` `fetchHeartbeat`) for the
  "watcher live" freshness stamp — liveness INDEPENDENT of book changes, because
  `positions.json`'s `generatedAt` only advances on a fill and legitimately freezes during
  quiet no-fill stretches. Does zero git; a stale heartbeat (>90s) is what trips the
  "watcher down?" warning
- `watchlist.json` — tracked repo-root watchlist (array of item names/ids); the app unions it
  with local `STATE.watchlist` and `screen.mjs` always scans it (S3); app writes it back via
  the GitHub contents API (`js/github.js`)
- `alerts.json` — tracked named price alerts (`{itemId, direction, price, note?}`) read by
  `pipeline/alerts.mjs` (N1); ships empty
- `hold-thesis.json` — tracked repo-root store (TG1, 2026-07-07): AGENT-WRITTEN declared hold plans,
  a flat array of `{id, exitPrice, tripwire, horizon, path, enteredUnder, ts}` (`path`/`enteredUnder`
  added additively by P4a — the js/paths.mjs entry-path declaration; legacy entries without them stay
  valid). When Ben declares a patient/accumulation hold ("accumulate nest, exit 4,848, tripwire 4,678,
  multi-day") the agent appends/upserts an entry (the greenlist pattern — hand-edit, `holdthesis.mjs
  upsertThesis`, or `thesis.mjs set … --path <key>` which declares the path/enteredUnder here); a
  14-day TTL prunes stale
  intent. `watch.mjs` reads it READ-ONLY through `pipeline/lib/holdthesis.mjs` and passes it into
  `convictionGate` (`lib/watchstate.mjs`): while the live price holds ABOVE the declared tripwire, the
  EXPECTED-underwater `UNDERWATER`/`CUT-CANDIDATE` headline is silenced to an armed note (being
  underwater vs the instant-clear IS the plan); below the tripwire the real-risk headline fires.
  `momVerdict` is untouched (the verdict stays honest); only the headline is gated. The Gate-2
  breakdown `CUT` is never silenced. Ships empty (`[]`); fixture-pinned in
  `pipeline/lib/holdthesis.test.mjs` + `pipeline/watchstate.test.mjs`.
- `ignored-items.json` — tracked repo-root config (2026-07-07): items QUARANTINED from the MERCH
  book (farming inputs / loot / personal-use — e.g. snapdragon seed 5300, snapdragon 3000). Its
  `items` are dropped from the DERIVED merch views (`positions.json` phantom lots + unmatched-harvest
  sells, `offers.json`, and watch's live-offer rows) while their raw events STAY in `fills.json`
  (full audit — this is a VIEW filter, never a deletion). A `greenlisted` array `[{id,qty,price,ts,
  consumed}]` surfaces a *specific* transaction as a real flip (matched on id + price ±3% + ts ±6h) —
  the agent appends one when Ben confirms a recommended flip of an ignored item (he only flips these
  on a rec, so every legit flip passes that gate). Read + matched by `pipeline/lib/ignored.mjs`,
  applied in `sync-fills.mjs` (positions/offers derivation) and `lib/offers.mjs activeOffers` (watch);
  fixture-pinned in `pipeline/ignored.test.mjs`.
- `suggestions.jsonl` — tracked, append-only suggestions ledger (O1): every emitted
  recommendation, one JSON object per line, written by `quote.mjs`/`screen.mjs`/`watch.mjs`
  via `pipeline/lib/suggestlog.mjs`. **Bounded to the CURRENT month (SR1):** on append,
  `logSuggestions` rolls any completed month out to a monthly archive (see below), so the
  root file never grows past ~a month of rows. F1-gating accrual is preserved — history is
  archived, never deleted.
- `pipeline/suggestions-archive/` — tracked dir of completed-month archive files
  `suggestions-YYYY-MM.jsonl` (SR1), moved OUT of the deploy root by `rotateLedger`
  (`pipeline/lib/suggestlog.mjs`). Same schema/lines as the active ledger; the append-only O1
  calibration history. Read together with the active file via `readSuggestionLines` — any full-
  history reader (`outcomes.mjs`'s F1 join) MUST use that helper, not the active file alone.
  Created lazily on the first rotation (empty until a month completes); committed by
  `sync-fills.mjs` alongside `suggestions.jsonl`.
- `screen.json` — the published opportunity screen the app's Scan tab renders (written by
  `screen.mjs --publish`)
- `docs/` — repo docs that aren't app/pipeline reference: `PLANNING.md` (the planning process
  itself — required plan sections, chunk design rules, the skills improvement loop, anti-patterns;
  written 2026-07-08, follow it when producing any improvement plan; `docs/LORE.md` will join it
  at Pipeline-v2 P7)
- `.gitattributes` — repo EOL normalization (GA1): text sources (`*.js`/`*.mjs`/`*.json`/
  `*.jsonl`/`*.md`/`*.yml`/`*.css`/`*.html`/`*.log` + `.gitignore`/`LICENSE`) are `text eol=lf`,
  the Windows batch launchers (`serve.cmd`/`watch-log.cmd`/`*.cmd`) are `text eol=crlf`, and
  `*.png` is `binary`. Makes line endings explicit instead of per-machine `core.autocrlf`
  guessing — that guessing is what emitted the recurring Windows "LF will be replaced by CRLF"
  warnings on commits touching `suggestions.jsonl`/`pipeline/.guide-history.jsonl`/`PLAN.md`
- `pipeline/` — RuneLite fill-data pipeline + node analysis scripts; not served by
  Pages, not part of the app. **CLI entrypoints live directly in `pipeline/`; the
  imported-only libraries they share live in `pipeline/lib/`** (OR2 — the split makes the
  CLI-vs-lib distinction structural, since the exec bit doesn't):
  - **CLI entrypoints (`pipeline/*.mjs`, run directly):** `sync-fills.mjs` (parse logs →
    `fills.json`/`positions.json`/`offers.json`, commit + push; `--local` writes them with
    **zero git** for desk-side freshness — LW1, exported `regenerate()` core),
    `watch-log.mjs` (LW1 local daemon — `fs.watch` the exchange-logger dir + `regenerate()`
    in-process on every change, ~10s debounce, **zero git**; also writes a liveness
    `heartbeat.json` at the repo root every ~30s (LW3, zero git) so the localhost stamp shows
    "watcher live" independent of book changes; started manually via
    `watch-log.cmd`, dies with the terminal — see `FILLS-PIPELINE.md` §14),
    `add-manual-fill.mjs` (inject/tombstone
    manual fills), `quote.mjs` (per-item / `--positions` market table; PM1 appends a stdout-only
    `Probes` column on the per-item read when a probe fires. P0: `--positions` now builds the shared
    `context.mjs` chain per lot — reads the root `offers.json` book (→ `HOLD — ask filling`) + the
    watch loop's `.cache/watch-state.json` READ-ONLY (→ a conviction line, never written here) + any
    declared hold thesis, renders the verdict via the shared `renderHeldVerdict`, and runs one
    `loadSnapshot()` per pass for the passive Tier-1 archive append. P4b: also runs the shared
    `pathsStage` per lot off the SAME watch-state entry — READ-ONLY, never persisted here — and
    prints a `Paths (persistence-gated dominant per held lot)` block via the shared `renderPathLine`), `screen.mjs`
    (opportunity screen; YP2 adds a stdout-only "WATCH CLOSELY" transition list; PM1 appends a
    stdout-only `Probes` column per niche when a probe fires — never in the published `screen.json`),
    `watch.mjs` (adaptive live position/offer monitor; also appends
    change-only guide-price observations to `pipeline/.guide-history.jsonl` — below, and holds
    the V1/V2 cross-pass memory: it emits per-pass Δ context + structural-support lines via
    `lib/watchstate.mjs`/`lib/levels.mjs`, persisting `pipeline/.cache/watch-state.json`; each held
    lot's note block follows the V5 EMIT CONTRACT built by `lib/emit.mjs`. P0: the held verdict prose
    is now the SHARED `renderHeldVerdict` (verbose mode) from `lib/context.mjs` — the ONE home
    quote.mjs renders from too — and each pass runs one `loadSnapshot()` for the passive Tier-1
    archive append (per-item live fetch semantics unchanged). P4b: each held pass also runs the
    shared `pathsStage` (weigh thesis-paths + the `pathPersistence` arm-then-confirm/hysteresis gate)
    and persists the additive `currentPath`/`pathArmedKey`/`pathArmedSince`/`enteredUnder` fields on
    the `held:<id>` watch-state entry — watch.mjs is the ONE writer; the note block gains the
    `renderPathLine` dominant-path field (decision support, never an alert)),
    `monitor.mjs`
    (live read-only log-state snapshot), `thesis.mjs` (YT1 #4 — CLI to set/clear/list the SESSION
    THESIS per item, the sole writer of gitignored `.cache/session-thesis.json`; watch.mjs reads it
    to print a per-held reminder. **P4a** — `set … --path <key> [--entered-under <key>]` ALSO declares
    the path-engine entry path into the TRACKED root `hold-thesis.json` via `holdthesis.upsertThesis`,
    preserving any existing plan fields; enteredUnder defaults to the path on first declaration),
    `cash.mjs` (CLI to set/read/clear the STATED idle-cash balance
    in `.capital-state.json` — the total-capital denominator `watch.mjs`'s SUMMARY reads),
    `windowrange.mjs` (né `nightlows.mjs` — time-of-day
    range read / overnight fill-realism scoring), `alerts.mjs` (N1 push-notification trigger
    engine — behind the standard `import.meta.url === pathToFileURL(argv[1])` invocation guard
    (TD2) so importing it for tests never runs/fetches; exports `positionSignal`/`quietSuppresses`),
    `outcomes.mjs` (derived campaign/outcomes join — gitignored output; schema v2 (YS1) adds per-campaign
    `stateAtFill` (band-pctl+regime+phase AS OF the fill via `lib/histstate.mjs`, for EVERY fill),
    measured `holdTimeSec`/`parkedSec`/`velocityClass`, and `predicted` (copied from the joined
    suggestion, null on pre-YS2 rows); reconstruction routes through `dedupeSnapshots`)
  - **Shared libraries (`pipeline/lib/*.mjs`, imported only):** `reconstruct.mjs` (shared
    FIFO reconstruction + `dedupeSnapshots`), `offers.mjs` (exchange-log discovery + open-offer
    semantics; P0 also adds `readOffersSnapshot`/`askFromSnapshot`/`bidFromSnapshot` — the OTHER-machine-safe
    reader of the flat root `offers.json`, normalized to the `{price,filled,total}` shape the context
    position stage wants, so quote.mjs can see the live book without the `~/.runelite` log dir),
    `positions.mjs` (shared `readOpenPositions` open-lot grouping), `archive.mjs`
    (D0 — the Tier-1 SQLite market archive: a thin `node:sqlite` (`DatabaseSync`) wrapper storing
    RAW `/1h`+`/5m` bulk observations keyed `(grain, ts, itemId)` with `INSERT OR IGNORE` + WAL/
    busy_timeout. `open`/`append`/`seriesFor`/`marketAt`/`exportFixture`/`pruneBefore`; NEVER archives
    `/latest` (no idempotent bucket); stores only raw fields — every derived value is recomputed by
    pure functions, never cached; `hasBucket` is the check-before-fetch predicate. Backs `loadDaily`
    (with a one-time `daily_seed` import of the pre-D0 `.cache/daily` mids). Surgically suppresses the
    one `node:sqlite` ExperimentalWarning via a `process.emitWarning` filter installed before a
    `createRequire` load — no global `--no-warnings` flag on any script. CLI: `node
    pipeline/lib/archive.mjs [--prune-before <ts>]` (prune shipped, unused by default)), `marketfetch.mjs`
    (node-side price/guide fetch layer + historical bands `loadHistBands`/past-anchored 6h series
    `loadHistDaily` (YF1) + `loadDaily` re-pointed at the D0 archive (byte-identical `{ts,mid}` output,
    proven vs the old cache) + `loadSnapshot()` — the D0 per-pass immutable context `{ts, latest, v24,
    mapping, guide, archive, series(id)}` composed from the existing loaders, passively accruing the
    archive (appends the current bulk `/1h`+`/5m` buckets, check-before-fetch) + the FC1 opt-in cross-invocation fetch
    cache — `setFetchCache`/`cachedJget` serve the per-item GETs from gitignored `.cache/fetch/`
    within per-endpoint TTLs; OFF by default so decision paths stay byte-identical), `cli.mjs` (shared arg/format/table
    helpers), `rating.mjs` (grade/score model), `gatecandidates.mjs` (P1 — screen.mjs's PURE
    candidate-selection + survival doctrine, moved out of screen.mjs so it's node-importable +
    fixture-testable with synthetic data: the pre-fetch `gateCandidates` gate stack + the
    `risingPoolFloor` predicate (GC1's threshold-driven form, default `DEFAULT_THRESHOLDS`), the
    fetch-pool ranker `rankAndSlice` + `proxyDrift` + `softFactor` (+ `expUnits`), and the extracted
    post-fetch `surviveMode(mode,row,phase,opts)` — falling-exclusion/`--phase-rescue`/rising-confirm/
    overnight-posture, returning `{keep,discardReason,rescued}` that maps 1:1 onto renderMode's `disc`
    counters; logic byte-identical to the old inline code, diff-proven), `replay.mjs` (P1 — the
    snapshot-replay acceptance ENGINE: `buildSnapshot()` expands five synthetic ARCHETYPES into a full
    raw market snapshot (`coffer-replay-snapshot/1`, a documented superset of D0's archive fixture —
    it also carries v24/band/latest/timeseries/daily so the whole funnel runs offline) anchored to a
    fixed `ANCHOR_TS`; `runReplay(snapshot,opts)` drives the WHOLE per-niche funnel — `gateCandidates`
    → `rankAndSlice` → `computeQuote`/`phase` → `surviveMode` — and returns the per-niche stage
    outputs (`gated`/`ranked`/`survivors`/`kept`/`dropped`) the golden pins. Pure/offline, no live API,
    no real SQLite), `suggestlog.mjs` (shared `suggestions.jsonl` appender + SR1
    rotation: `logSuggestions` rolls completed months into `pipeline/suggestions-archive/suggestions-YYYY-MM.jsonl`
    on append via `rotateLedger` — no-row-loss archive-then-truncate, idempotent — and `readSuggestionLines`
    reunites active+archives for full-history readers; YS2 `suggestionEntry` also lean-includes the
    forward prediction fields — `posture` and the plumbing for `tripwire`/`fillWindowHrs`/`velocityClass`/`thesis` —
    written only when a caller honestly supplies them, so legacy rows stay byte-identical; P2 also
    lean-includes a `validators` flag list). **`windowread.mjs` MOVED to `js/`** (P2 — see the `js/`
    inventory above; consumed here by `windowrange.mjs`/`watch.mjs`),
    `watchstate.mjs` (V1/V4/V7 — PURE cross-pass temporal memory for the watch loop: `computeDeltas`/
    `advanceState` compute Δ instabuy, mom transitions, `passesUnderwater`/`passesBelowSupport` counters
    (display), the `underwaterSince`/`belowSupportSince`/`breakdownSince` streak timestamps, and band-top
    drift, with a reset policy on identity change / `STALE_GAP_MS`; plus the `convictionGate()` — the pure
    arm-then-confirm ALERT-escalation decision, now **TIME-based (V7, `ALERT_PERSIST_MS`)** so alert
    sensitivity is independent of loop cadence (Gate-2 breakdown CUT exempt/immediate; Gate-D
    CUT-CANDIDATE, structural break, AND `LIST-TO-CLEAR` gated on elapsed persistence). **P4b** adds
    `pathPersistence()` — the SAME arm-then-confirm discipline applied to PATH DOMINANCE: a dominance
    flip must beat the incumbent by `PATH_HYSTERESIS_MARGIN` and hold for `PATH_PERSIST_MS` (both
    named placeholders) before the persisted `currentPath` changes; a flip-back disarms, so flapping
    weights never whiplash the headline path. State entries grow the ADDITIVE `currentPath`/
    `pathArmedKey`/`pathArmedSince`/`enteredUnder` fields (legacy entries stay byte-identical —
    fixture-pinned in `pathpersist.test.mjs`).
    Thin `loadState`/`saveState` are the only fs surface — verdict strings untouched, `momVerdict`
    untouched), `levels.mjs`

    per-HELD-lot note block — `verdict · conviction · Δ · tripwire · recovery-read (V6) · path (P4b) ·

    orders/formats already-computed pieces, decides nothing — output-format-only),
    `recovery.mjs` (V6 — PURE `recoveryRead`/`recoveryLine`/`recoveryTrigger`: the ADVISORY
    recover-vs-drop LEAN that COMPOSES momVerdict's existing signals (diurnal · regime/phase ·
    underwater-persistence · vs structural support) + the trigger gating that surfaces it only on a
    non-clean position — decides NOTHING, never a verdict/alert input; a `spike` caps confidence),
    `capital.mjs` (V6 Companion — PURE `freedCapital`: detects capital freed by a booked SELL between
    passes off V1's prior-pass state and prompts a redeploy scan ≥ `FREED_CAPITAL_SCAN_GP` — surface-
    only, never auto-places/runs the scan; anchor-free, no startup/stale-gap misfire),

    `bookUtilization` (working-held vs parked-bid capital split) + `parkedStats` (historical
    "how long bids sat" + velocity mix over outcomes campaigns) + `totalCapital` (committed +
    STATED idle cash → the WHOLE-pool idle-vs-working split, null-safe when cash is unknown);

    `velocitytag.mjs` (Build 2 — PURE `buildVelocityIndex`/`velocityTag` over the gitignored
    outcomes.json campaigns: per-item dominant velocity + median time-to-first-fill + % of bids that

    is all baselines); advisory line on quote/watch, never a verdict input),
    `sessionthesis.mjs` (YT1 #4 — PURE session-thesis state model: `loadThesis`/`saveThesis`/`upsert`/
    `clear`/`prune`/`thesisLine`, the intent-per-lane store watch.mjs reads read-only; persists like
    watchstate),
    `holdthesis.mjs` (TG1 — PURE declared-hold-thesis store: `loadHoldThesis`/`saveHoldThesis`/
    `thesisFor`/`upsertThesis`/`clearThesis`/`pruneHoldThesis` over the TRACKED root `hold-thesis.json`
    array of `{id,exitPrice,tripwire,horizon,path,enteredUnder,ts}` — **P4a** grew the additive optional
    `path`/`enteredUnder` (the js/paths.mjs entry-path declaration; LEGACY entries without them stay
    fully valid, both default null); watch.mjs reads it read-only and feeds it to `convictionGate` to
    SILENCE the expected-underwater headline while live holds above the declared tripwire — never
    touches `momVerdict`; fixture-pinned `holdthesis.test.mjs`),
    `context.mjs` (P0 — the ITEM CONTEXT CHAIN + the ONE shared held-verdict renderer: staged PURE
    enrichers `identityStage`/`marketStage`/`historyStage`/`intradayStage`/`positionStage` +
    `buildItemContext` build an `ItemContext` (identity → market row → history/phase → intraday series
    → position: lot/break-even/lotValue/askFilling/lotCtx + the ONE `momVerdict` + the `convictionGate`
    arm-then-confirm, off the caller-loaded offers.json book + watch-state + hold thesis). The position
    stage is the home that ENDS the quote-vs-watch verdict fork — `renderHeldVerdict(ctx,{mode})` emits
    `compact` (quote.mjs `--positions` cell) or `verbose` (watch.mjs heldAction line) off the SAME
    `heldMomVerdict(ctx)`, byte-identical to the pre-P0 inline functions (verified diff), so the two
    surfaces can't disagree; `HOLD — ask filling` now prints on BOTH (quote lacked the offer read).
    **P4b** adds the `pathsStage` chain slice (derives the js/paths.mjs scoring ctx from the built
    namespaces, weighs the lot's thesis-paths, runs the `pathPersistence` gate off the shared
    watch-state entry, and folds the path fields ADDITIVELY into `newStateEntry`; `enteredUnder`
    comes from the hold-thesis entry — never fabricated — and the declared `path` seeds the incumbent
    on a path-less state file) + `renderPathLine(ctx)` — the ONE shared dominant-path line both
    surfaces print beside the verdict (a CONFIRMED migration headlines as `path MIGRATED a → b`;
    decision support, never an alert input; the verdict strings stay byte-identical).
    No fetch/fs — every stage is node-importable + fixture-pinned in `context.test.mjs`), `histstate.mjs` (YF1 — reconstruct MARKET STATE AS OF a past timestamp: the PURE `deriveState`
    composes `loadHistBands` + `loadHistDaily` into the SHIPPED `regimeDrift`/`regimeLabel`/`phase`
    classifiers → band-percentile + regime + phase at a fill/placement time, with `reconstructed:false`
    honesty when the history is gone; the shared seam #1(a)'s every-fill classification + #2's
    state-transition scan both read — no market math re-implemented),
    `modules.mjs` (PM1 — the probe-module LOADER + stage-keyed runner: auto-discovers
    `pipeline/modules/*.mjs`, groups by stage (`observe`/`price`/`gate`), and `runProbes(row,surface,ctx)`
    returns the fired display annotations. **Presence = enabled** (delete the file to disable). The
    **empty-passthrough guarantee** — no module present or none fire ⇒ `[]` ⇒ nothing appends ⇒
    byte-identical output — is the removability contract. `collectNeeds` exposes the multi-item
    `needs(row,ctx)` sibling-id declaration (decant). NO probe of any stage feeds a
    verdict/gate/rating/reconstruction — observe probes touch no number, price probes touch only the
    advisory recommendation. `logFirings(fired,meta)` (PM2) appends the fired annotations to
    `pipeline/modules/<module>.log` — called by each surface AFTER the PURE runProbes; failure-safe)
  - **Probe modules (`pipeline/modules/*.mjs`, PM1 — experimental per-item theory plug-ins):** each a
    pure `{name,version,theory,stage,surfaces,needs?,probe}` file, trial-and-keep-or-drop, surfaced in
    the stdout `Probes` column on screen/quote (never a verdict/gate/rating input). `dip.mjs`
    (`observe` — live instasell under the 24h avg low on a flat/rising non-decay reliable non-thin book
    ⇒ `⬇DIP -N%`, the migrated ex-`screen.mjs` prototype; owned ⇒ average-down framing for the watch
    follow-on), `froth.mjs` (`observe` — a spike/rising CLASSIFIER: rising/holding lows ⇒

    arbitrage: reads 1/2/3-dose sibling prices off the whole-market 24h map (`ctx.v24all`) and flags a
    lower dose whose per-4-dose cost beats the 4-dose; declares its siblings via `needs()`; screen-only,
    since the per-item quote surface has no whole-market map). The gitignored `pipeline/modules/<name>.log`
    firing log is now WIRED (PM2): `logFirings` appends one compact JSONL line per firing —
    `{ts,module,version,stage,surface,id,name,tag,price(price-stage),quickBuy,quickSell,guide,regimeLabel,phase}`

  - `pipeline/fixtures/replay/snapshot.json` + `golden.json` (**tracked**, P1) — the committed inputs +
    expected outputs for `replay.test.mjs`. `snapshot.json` is a `coffer-replay-snapshot/1` synthetic
    market state (five archetypes — stable band, genuine dip, thin big ticket, decay-knife, falling
    wide-band; no PII, no live data), produced by `lib/replay.mjs` `buildSnapshot()`; `golden.json`
    (`coffer-replay-golden/1`) is the per-niche funnel result `runReplay` must reproduce. Regenerate
    both with `node pipeline/replay.test.mjs --update` (hand-review the diff). Consumer: `replay.test.mjs`.
  - gitignored scratch is consolidated under `pipeline/.cache/` (OR2): the market caches plus
    `mapping.cache.json`, `.alerts-state.json`, the optional `held-override.json`, the FC1
    `fetch/` per-URL cache (opt-in cross-invocation fetch cache — one `{ts,url,data}` file per
    cached GET, disposable), the YF1 `outcomes-daily/` per-item reduced past 1h@6h series (sibling
    of `outcomes-bands/`), the YT1 `session-thesis.json` (intent-per-lane store; `thesis.mjs` writes,
    watch.mjs reads), and
    `watch-state.json` (V1 — the watch loop's cross-pass memory: a keyed map
    `held:<id>`/`bid:<id>:<offer>` → `{ts, identity, instabuy, mom, bandTop, breakEven, support,
    underwater, passesUnderwater, belowSupport, passesBelowSupport, bandTopHist[]}`, rewritten fresh
    each pass by `watch.mjs` so vanished positions drop out; counters reset on identity change or a
    gap > `STALE_GAP_MS`. Local, disposable —
    deleting it just loses one pass of delta history)
  - `pipeline/.guide-history.jsonl` (**tracked** as of 2026-07-06 — Ben's call: it's an accruing
    observation record, so it lives in the repo to survive a lost machine; kept OUTSIDE `.cache/`
    so cache pruning never touches it) — change-only GE guide-price observations for watched items,
    one JSON line `{ts,id,name,guide,prev}` per observed change, appended by `watch.mjs`
    `logGuideChanges()` at watch cadence. Purpose: pin each item's ~daily guide-update
    time + magnitude to feed the guide-re-anchor pricing edge (PLAN.md Discovered,
    2026-07-06). Consumer: `pipeline/lib/guideanchor.mjs` (YP1 — the guide re-anchor model, honesty-gated
    on accrual; quote.mjs/watch.mjs surface its advisory line, silent until enough real updates accrue). (Not auto-committed by
    `sync-fills.mjs`; commit it periodically so the record on `origin` stays current.)
  - `pipeline/.market-archive.sqlite` (+ `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars) — **gitignored, machine-local, D0**:
    the Tier-1 SQLite market archive. Append-forever RAW `/1h`+`/5m` whole-market observations
    (~30–35GB/yr, Ben-approved) that the wiki API only serves ~30h/item live — the ONLY route to broad
    intraday history, feeding P3's term structure + P6's backtests. Deliberately OUTSIDE `pipeline/.cache/`
    (that tree is disposable/pruned; the archive must survive). Producer: `pipeline/lib/archive.mjs`
    (`append`, via `loadDaily`/`loadSnapshot`). Consumers: `loadDaily`'s regime proxy + P3's
    `js/termstructure.mjs` durable-floor read (via `loadDaily`, incl. the read-only `{noFetch:true}` path
    quote.mjs uses); the Pipeline-v2 context chain (P0+) as it lands. NEVER committed (huge, machine-local,
    reproducible-by-accrual).
  - `FILLS-PIPELINE.md` (pipeline design + operations) and `MONITORING.md` (live-monitoring
    routine). The `quote.mjs`/`screen.mjs`/`watch.mjs` scripts import `js/quotecore.js` +
    `js/format.js` so their tables match the app exactly.

## Map of the repo

Two things bite when you move or edit a file here, so they get their own map: the root
**data artifacts** (some are load-bearing at fixed paths; some are free to move) and the
two **shared logic modules** that are served to the browser *and* imported by node.

### Root data artifacts

**ROOT-LOCKED** — the app fetches these same-origin and/or the deployed phone writes them at
hardcoded contents-API paths, so moving any one is a coordinated app + pipeline +
deployed-phone change (not a rename):

| File | What locks it to the root |
| --- | --- |
| `positions.json` | app fetches same-origin (`js/ledger.js` `syncFills`) |
| `offers.json` | app fetches same-origin on localhost (`js/ledger.js` `fetchOffers`, LW2) — live GE offer snapshot written by `sync-fills.mjs`/`watch-log.mjs` |
| `screen.json` | app fetches same-origin (`js/ui.js` Scan tab) |
| `watchlist.json` | app fetches same-origin (`js/ui.js`) **and** the phone writes it back via the contents API (`js/github.js` `WATCHLIST_PATH`) |
| `mobile-fills.log` | the phone appends slot-9 lines via the contents API (`js/github.js` `MOBILE_LOG_PATH`); `sync-fills.mjs` reads it |
| `fills.json` | the pipeline source `positions.json` is FIFO-reconstructed from; `sync-fills.mjs` commits it at the root (not app-fetched directly, but coupled to the same convention) |

**Pipeline-only / movable** — no app fetch and no hardcoded remote path; a single path
constant governs each, so these can move without touching the deployed app or phone:

| File | Producer / consumer | Tracked? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `alerts.json` | read by `pipeline/alerts.mjs` (N1) | tracked (ships empty) |
| `suggestions.jsonl` | appended by `pipeline/lib/suggestlog.mjs` (O1 fields + YS2 forward `posture?`/…); SR1-bounded to the current month | tracked, append-only |
| `pipeline/suggestions-archive/suggestions-YYYY-MM.jsonl` | completed months rolled out of the active ledger by `rotateLedger` (SR1); read with the active file via `readSuggestionLines` | tracked, append-only (lazy) |
| `outcomes.json` | derived by `pipeline/outcomes.mjs` (F1 join reads active+archives) | gitignored |

### Shared logic modules

`js/quotecore.js` and `js/format.js` are served to the browser **and** imported by node —
an edit ripples into the pipeline scripts and CI, not just the app. After editing either,
run `pipeline/quotecore.test.mjs` + `pipeline/reconstruct.test.mjs`.

| Module | Also imported by (pipeline) |
| --- | --- |
| `js/quotecore.js` | 10 files: `quote.mjs`, `screen.mjs`, `watch.mjs`, `monitor.mjs`, `alerts.mjs`, `lib/cli.mjs`, `lib/reconstruct.mjs`, `add-manual-fill.mjs`, `quotecore.test.mjs`, `watchcore.test.mjs` (`offerVerdict`, shared with the app Watch tab) |
| `js/format.js` | 5 files: `quote.mjs`, `screen.mjs`, `watch.mjs`, `alerts.mjs`, `outcomes.mjs`; also `js/strategies.mjs` (P4c — `tax` for the spec edges) |
| `js/windowread.mjs` | `pipeline/windowrange.mjs`, `pipeline/watch.mjs`, `js/validate.mjs`, `pipeline/windowread.test.mjs` (P2 — moved from `pipeline/lib/`; not yet app-imported) |
| `js/validate.mjs` | `pipeline/screen.mjs`, `pipeline/quote.mjs`, `pipeline/validate.test.mjs`, `pipeline/termstructure.test.mjs` (P2/P3 — the validator registry: reach + floor; not yet app-imported) |
| `js/termstructure.mjs` | `js/validate.mjs`, `pipeline/screen.mjs`, `pipeline/quote.mjs`, `pipeline/termstructure.test.mjs` (P3 — term structure / durable floor; not yet app-imported) |
| `js/paths.mjs` | `pipeline/lib/context.mjs` (`pathsStage`, P4b — so `watch.mjs` + `quote.mjs --positions` at runtime), `js/strategies.mjs` (P4c — `PATH_KEYS` vocabulary), `pipeline/screen.mjs` (P4c — per-row entry-path annotation), `pipeline/paths.test.mjs`, `pipeline/pathpersist.test.mjs` (not yet app-imported) |
| `js/strategies.mjs` | `pipeline/lib/gatecandidates.mjs` (spec-driven gate edge/pool/rank), `pipeline/screen.mjs` (mode-name lists + `defaultPath`), `pipeline/strategies.test.mjs` (P4c — the declarative niche registry; not yet app-imported) |

### Test-location convention

Tests are `*.test.mjs` files **colocated next to the code they pin** (e.g.
`pipeline/quotecore.test.mjs` sits beside its subject, `pipeline/lib/rating.test.mjs` beside
`pipeline/lib/rating.mjs`) — there is **never** a `tests/` directory; adjacency beats grouping
for agents. Each test is plain `node <file>.test.mjs` (no framework — copy the shape of an
existing one). They are **auto-discovered**: `pipeline/run-tests.mjs` recursively finds every
`pipeline/**/*.test.mjs`, runs each in its own child process, and exits non-zero if any suite
fails **or** if zero suites are found. CI (`.github/workflows/checks.yml`) and `/ship` call the
runner once, so **adding a test file is the whole job** — nothing else wires it in. Follow the
same rule for `js/` and `pipeline/lib/` subjects: put the test beside the file (tests for `js/`
subjects live under `pipeline/`, which is where the runner globs — the `quotecore.test.mjs`/
`format.test.mjs` precedent).

## Local development

ES module scripts can't load over `file://` (browsers block it for CORS reasons),
so double-clicking `index.html` won't work. Run **`serve.cmd`** (tries the `py`
launcher's `http.server`, falls back to `python3`, then `npx serve`) and open
`http://localhost:8000/`. GitHub Pages is unaffected — it always serves over HTTP.

`serve.cmd` is also the **live desk experience** (LW2): it now `start /b`s the
`watch-log.mjs` daemon in the same console (one Ctrl+C stops both, commit `74e437a`), so no
separate `watch-log.cmd` step is needed. On localhost the app polls `positions.json` +
`offers.json` + `heartbeat.json` every ~30s, so with RuneLite running every fill / cancel /
reprice shows up in the local app within ~40s — no keystrokes, **zero git commits**. The
**Watch tab** (0.49.0) is the desk surface over this data: verdict-first held cards, active
offers, today's fills, with a two-part freshness stamp instead of the deployed
Refresh-positions banner — **`watcher live hh:mm`** (from `heartbeat.json`, the real daemon
liveness signal — warns "watcher down?" if >90s stale) **·** `book synced hh:mm` (from
`positions.json`, informational, no age warning since a frozen book is normal when trading is
quiet). This split (LW3) fixed a false "is the watcher running?" alarm the old
positions-only stamp raised during no-fill stretches. On `bensumm.github.io` the poll is off
and the M1 banner + button are unchanged.

Data sources are the OSRS Wiki real-time prices API, the in-game GE guide price
(wiki module + weirdgloop history), all fetched client-side.

## Deploy

`git push` to `main` auto-deploys via GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → deploy from
`main` / root). There is **no service worker**, so there's no cache to invalidate —
the next launch serves the new files. Deploy typically lands within ~1 minute.

## Persistence

State lives in **IndexedDB** (ledger, watchlist, settings, the growing hourly price
archives, cached snapshots), with a `localStorage`/in-memory fallback. Use the in-app
**Export** button periodically as a backstop — browsers can evict site storage under
pressure, even for installed PWAs. Export/Import round-trips the full state as JSON.

## Notes for future work

- A service worker (network-first for the HTML) would add an offline shell, but the
  app needs the live wiki API to be useful, so it was intentionally omitted.
- For an edge-to-edge iOS look: switch `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` to
  `black-translucent`, add `viewport-fit=cover` to the viewport meta, pad the header
  with `env(safe-area-inset-top)`.
