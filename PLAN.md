# PLAN — The Coffer master plan (single plan file, 2026-07-04)

This is the **only** plan file. The prior docs — `PLAN-2.md`, `PLAN-3.md`, `PLAN-4.md`,
`PLAN-5.md` — are deleted; their full text (rationale, findings, long-form specs) lives in
git history: `git show 39e5d23:PLAN-4.md` (same sha serves all four). Every chunk below is
self-sufficient for an executor; the git-show pointers are backstory, not required reading.
When a chunk ships, mark it ✅ in the Status table **in this file** with the commit sha —
single-file discipline: this doc is both the plan and the scoreboard.

**Shipped-chunk detail has been folded out (2026-07-06).** Waves 1–7's per-chunk executor
briefs were pruned once every chunk in them landed — the Status table below keeps the
one-line "don't-rebuild" summary + sha for each, `CHANGELOG.md` and CLAUDE.md's "Done"
section hold the "why", and the full original spec is recoverable via `git show <sha>:PLAN.md`
(any pre-2026-07-06 commit). Only still-open work keeps its detailed spec here.

## Executor rules (apply to every chunk, verbatim)

- Each chunk ends with: `node --check` every touched `js/*.js` / `pipeline/*.mjs`; run
  `node pipeline/run-tests.mjs` (the auto-discovery runner — runs every `pipeline/**/*.test.mjs`)
  if any tested module was touched; a real browser or Playwright
  smoke test for any app-facing change (ES modules don't load over `file://` — use
  `serve.cmd`); `APP_VERSION` bump in `js/state.js` if app behavior changed (skills-only
  changes do NOT bump it — SKILL.md `version:` frontmatter instead); a descriptive commit,
  then land it (G1, 2026-07-04: `main` is protected by a PR+`checks` ruleset, but there's no
  merge queue on this user-owned repo and PR creation is token-blocked for now, so the
  practical path is **attended direct-push under the admin bypass** — `git fetch && rebase
  origin/main && push`; the `gh pr create`→`gh pr merge` flow is the intent once `gh auth
  refresh` lands — see `/ship` §2/§6) — and if the change touches the deployed app, watch the
  `pages-build-deployment` run to `completed success` (`gh run list -L 1`). Prefer
  exact-string edits that fail loudly.
- Repo is public — no PII in any tracked file or commit message.
- NEVER edit RuneLite's own `exchange.log`; the writable source is the sibling
  `coffer-manual.log`.
- `positions.json` / `fills.json` are pipeline outputs — only `sync-fills.mjs` writes them.
- `git add` only the files you changed. (There is no longer a scheduler auto-committing
  positions/fills — sync is on-demand since G1; but an attended sync push or another lane's
  merge can still move `main`, so rebase your branch on `origin/main` if it drifts.)
- Discover unrelated debt → append to "Discovered" at the bottom; don't fix drive-by.
- **Spec style:** write the rule + one cheap named anchor (e.g. "the bludgeon-exit lesson").
  Do NOT paste live data (prices, multi-item verification lists) — it rots and misleads.
- A reconciling documentation pass is part of every chunk (CLAUDE.md process rule 8):
  grep for statements the change supersedes and fix them in place — move, never copy.

## Dispatch model — coordinator + Opus subagents

- Ben's main session is the **coordinator**. It hands one chunk ID per **Opus subagent**
  (Agent tool). Subagent brief template: *"Read CLAUDE.md fully, then PLAN.md's Executor
  rules and chunk `<ID>`. Execute the chunk, validate per the rules, commit."*
- **Landing (G1, 2026-07-04):** `main` is protected by a PR+`checks` ruleset with a
  repository-admin **always** bypass. Because there's **no merge queue** (user-owned repo —
  unavailable) and **PR creation is currently token-blocked** (`createPullRequest` →
  `FORBIDDEN`, needs `gh auth refresh -s repo`), chunks land today by **attended direct-push
  under the admin bypass**; the coordinator still **hand-rebases each finished lane onto
  `main`** and pushes (parallel lanes use worktree isolation, `isolation: "worktree"`).
  Never force-push `main`. The PR-per-lane flow (which would let the queue serialize lanes)
  is the intent once the token is refreshed *and* the repo has a queue — see `/ship` §2/§6.
- **Parallel-safety rule:** chunks may run concurrently only when their primary-file sets
  are disjoint (listed per chunk). Same-file-different-region overlaps are acceptable
  (git merges them); same-function overlaps are not — sequence those.
- After each wave the coordinator: runs the test file + a browser smoke pass if the app
  changed, updates the Status table here, pushes.
- **Wave-start consistency scan (Wave 2 onward — Ben, 2026-07-04):** when kicking off each
  wave after the first, the coordinator also spawns a **Sonnet** subagent to sweep the
  repo's docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `PLAN.md`, `README.md`, `pipeline/*.md`,
  `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`) for drift the prior wave left behind — statements a shipped
  chunk superseded, stale column sets/verdict lists, chunk specs contradicted by what
  actually landed. Findings are wrapped into followup notes appended to that wave's chunk
  briefs (doc fixes ride with the owning chunk's reconciliation pass); findings that
  belong to no active chunk go to the Discovered list.

## Order of operations

Waves 1–7 have all shipped (see Status), and **PM1** (probe-module system) + **TG1**
(thesis-gated hold alerts) shipped 2026-07-08 (Fable lanes; shas in Status — specs pruned per
the fold-out discipline, recoverable via `git show a46e69a:PLAN.md`), followed the same day by
**PM2** (probe firing logs), **SR1** (suggestions rotation) and **GA1** (`.gitattributes`) —
shas in Status. **The Pipeline-v2 wave (D0→P8, folded from the 2026-07-08 planning round with
Ben) is now the active program** — specs below under "Pipeline v2 — open chunk specs"; F1 stays
gated on O1 thresholds (P6's evidence work feeds it). Everything else lives in the Discovered /
Needs-a-Ben-decision lists. The planning process itself is documented in `docs/PLANNING.md`.

| Wave | What (all ✅ — detail via `git show <sha>:PLAN.md`) |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | T1→T2 (tables + Trends) ∥ O1 (outcomes dataset) ∥ K1→K2→K3 (self-improving skills + memory dedupe + CLAUDE.md slimming) |
| **2** | S1→S2→S3 (screening economics → overnight posture → watchlist section) ∥ Q1 (Gate-0 reliability fix) ∥ E1 (local-time audit) |
| **3** | L1 (action logging) → G1 (PR flow + ruleset) → M1 (mobile parity) → N1 (push notifications) |
| **4** | Repo-review cleanup: D1 (doc reconciliation) ∥ R1→P1 (reconstruct harness → snapshot dedupe) ∥ X2→X1 (dead-scheduler excision → pipeline dedup) ∥ A1→A2→A3 (app dead-code → fetch unification → ledger split) ∥ BE1 (break-even tax-cap fix). W1 (analysis cadence) + CI1 (browser smoke in CI) independent. |
| **5** | UX round: TB1→LU1→FX1 (sortable table → Ledger UX → Finder/Signals fixes) ∥ NY1→NY2 (scan niche-yield audit → ruling) ∥ SY1 (sync-fills doctrine). |
| **6** | Business-logic tests + org: OR1 (org map docs) → OR2 (pipeline/lib/ split) → TD1 (money tests) → TD2 (extractions + tests) → TD3 (nice-to-have sweep). |
| **LW/LH** | LW1→LW2→LW3 (local log-watcher) ∥ LH1→LH2→LH3 (exchange-log hardening) — folded from standalone plan files, both shipped. |
| **7** | TC1 (trendcore extraction) ∥ GC1 (gateCandidates extraction) ∥ SL1 (suggestlog path regression). |
| **YIELD** | Yield-improvement program (folded from `PLAN-YIELD.md`, all shipped 2026-07-06): FC1 (fetch cache) → YF1 (historical market-state helper) → YS1 (outcomes v2 schema) ∥ YS2 (forward suggestion enrichment) → YV1 (velocity+capital-util #3) → YT1 (session-thesis #4) ∥ YP2 (state-transition scan #2) → YP1 (guide re-anchor #2, gated) → YA1 (in-app utilization #5). Full story: `CHANGELOG.md`. |
| **V2** | Pipeline v2 (ACTIVE): D0 (snapshot+SQLite archive) → P0 (context chain) → P1 (surface extraction + replay harness) → P2/P3 (validators, every surface) → P4a/b/c (path engine → persistence → declarative specs) → P5 (scalp/value + path-aware bids) → P6 (evidence viability) → P7 (docs/skills triage + skill-lint) → P8 (desk orchestrator). D0 ∥ P1-mechanical parallel-safe (disjoint primaries). |
| gated | **F1** (algorithm feedback) — opens only when O1's sample thresholds clear |

| PM2 | Probe firing logs — wire the hit/miss ledger | `pipeline/lib/modules.mjs` (`logFirings`), `screen.mjs`, `quote.mjs`, `modules.test.mjs` | ✅ `5ca4f95` (pipeline-only, no APP_VERSION; one JSONL line per firing to gitignored `pipeline/modules/<name>.log` — `{ts,module,version,stage,surface,id,name,tag,price?,quickBuy,quickSell,guide,regimeLabel,phase}`, enough to score without re-fetching. `runProbes` stays PURE — surfaces call `logFirings` explicitly after it; writes individually swallowed, no firing ⇒ no file; stdout byte-identical, live-diffed.

Position stage folds offers book + watch-state prior + `convictionGate` + hold thesis → ONE `momVerdict`; `renderHeldVerdict(ctx,{mode})` compact/verbose is the shared renderer, byte-identical to the pre-P0 inlines across all 9 branches (diff-proven) except the intended gain: quote `--positions` now reads offers.json so `HOLD — ask filling` prints there (THE PIN, both surfaces). quote+watch each run `loadSnapshot()` per pass — /5m archive accrual live. Sound deviations: position stage is source-agnostic (watch keeps its ~0-lag exchange-log book, feeds normalized offers to the same derivation); watch's snapshot is archive-append-only (`budgetIds:[]`, fetch semantics unchanged); quote's conviction runs without structural-support arm (no ts1h on booked-lots view — see Discovered); watch `main()` not re-sliced (identical `mv` via existing inline logic; re-slice risked V5 EMIT/single-alert/Gate-2 contracts) |

Screens DROP reject + FLAG caution, `rejected: N (top-3 reasons)` footer when N>0 + `--stats` counters (coordinator-ruled footer default, Ben-vetoable); held/asked never hidden (⚠ note); `suggestionEntry` gains lean `validators` field (YS2 pattern, clean rows byte-identical). PLACEHOLDER thresholds: REACH_CAUTION_FRAC 0.5, REACH_MIN_DAYS 5, window 8h/14n (REACH_REJECT_FRAC 0 is definitional). HONEST: reach degrades to pass on BOTH wired surfaces today — neither fetches ts1h (no-fetch-change constraint); framework is live for P3's floorValidator, activation gap in Discovered) |
| V2-P3 | floorValidator + term structure off the archive | `js/validate.mjs`, new term-structure module | ✅ `b55f895` (pipeline-only, no APP_VERSION; new PURE `js/termstructure.mjs` — 1/3/7/14/28d structure over daily mids, durable floor = 0.15-quantile of the longest ≥6-point multi-week lookback, typical fluctuation = its IQR (spike-robust); lives in `js/` because `js/validate.mjs` imports it (same layering rule as windowread). `floorValidator` (registry now `['reach','floor']`) is BUY-side only: buy > 2.0× typical swings above floor → reject, > 1.0× → caution; held lots degrade immediately (`held-lot-sell-side`) so positions reviews are untouched. No fetch change: screen feeds the daily series already loaded at gate time; quote reads archived mids via `loadDaily({noFetch:true})`. 17-check `termstructure.test.mjs` pins decay-knife reject + genuine-dip pass on both surface shapes; 39/39 suites. Live: drew a real caution on Masori body — first validator to actually fire (P2's activation gap partly closed on the buy side).

HONEST: archive accrual started 2026-07-08 — thin-history items degrade to pass until the series warms (daily_seed bridges ~17d for established items).

## Open chunk specs

### F1 — Algorithm feedback loop (GATED on O1's n thresholds)

The payoff of O1. Fill-probability/fill-time curves by band-percentile × item class →
replace `patientTargets`' fixed 20th/80th percentiles with class-conditional choices;
observed time-to-fill replaces `Exp gp/d`'s cycle-time assumptions; realized-vs-suggested
calibration report (the O1 suggestion join makes it a query). Known confound: regime mix —
bucket outcomes by regime label before believing any curve. Do not start until O1's
documented sample thresholds clear (n≥30 per side×pctl×class×regime cell, ≥5 cells —
currently 1; process rule 4). Realistically weeks of accrual away at ~20 lots/day.

## Pipeline v2 — open chunk specs (folded from the 2026-07-08 planning round; ACTIVE)

**Problem.** The pipeline "fights itself": scripts disagree on the same item, judgment lives as
prose in skills, and a verdict is treated as a property of the item alone when it is really
**(item × the strategy thesis you entered under)** — anchor incident: the Hydra leather buy
(13.5m mid-decay, NOT the multi-week floor; no script ran the reach/floor checks that were prose
in `/scan`), then whiplash hold/cut advice from the `quote.mjs`-vs-`watch.mjs` verdict fork.
Three roots, three fixes: different fetch instants → the Snapshot layer (D0); forked verdict
logic → the Context chain + one judgment home in `js/` (P0/P4); per-surface gate differences →
shared validators on every surface (P2/P3).

**Ben's rulings (2026-07-08):** falling-exclusion doctrine AMENDED (falling ≠ auto-bad; needs
history/typical-fluctuation review; no CANCEL-BID off falling regime alone for a deliberate
thesis — memory `falling-exclusion-amended`); evidence-based viability, not hand weights; ONE
verdict home (`js/`); declarative strategy specs; every single-item analysis runs validation;
encode-in-scripts wherever mechanical; SQLite archive may grow ~100GB; app work DEFERRED (Ben
isn't using it; stale tabs may be archived) — no APP_VERSION bumps in this wave.

### Architecture

```
Snapshot (D0) ─▶ Surface ─▶ Context chain ─▶ VALIDATE ─▶ PATH ENGINE ─▶ Render (per-script)
```

- **Data tiers:** Tier 0 = live bulk (`/latest`,`/24h`, 3–4 fetches/tick total; all surfacing
  gates). Tier 1 = the SQLite archive (`node:sqlite`, verified Node v22.16; thin
  `pipeline/lib/archive.mjs` wrapper) — each run appends the bulk `/1h` AND `/5m` snapshots;
  bulk `/5m` accrual is the only route to broad intraday history (API serves ~30h/item) and
  feeds P6's backtests. Tier 2 = per-item timeseries, budgeted to the fetch pool (existing
  `rankAndSlice` TOP + `fetchTsCached`).
- **No duplicates by construction:** archive ONLY bucketed endpoints (API-supplied bucket ts;
  never `/latest`); PK `(grain, ts, itemId)` + `INSERT OR IGNORE`; check bucket-already-stored
  BEFORE fetching. WAL + busy_timeout for concurrent writers.
- **No-blowup rules:** store only raw observations; EVERYTHING derived (regime, phase, term
  structure, bands, validator results, path scores) is recomputed by pure functions — never
  cached. Append forever (~30–35GB/yr, Ben-approved); `--prune-before` utility ships unused.
- **Context chain:** one `ItemContext` via staged pure enrichers, each owning a namespace,
  nulls degrade downstream (the momVerdict optional-degradation precedent):
  identity → market (Tier 0 row) → history (Tier 1: term structure/phase/fluctuation/window) →
  intraday (Tier 2: ts5m/bands/reach) → position (lot, BE, offers.json, watch-state, thesis/path)
  → validate → paths → render. Scripts = slices of the chain + a renderer.
- **Validate:** registry of pure validators `(ctx) → {status: pass|caution|reject, reason,
  evidence}` in `js/validate.mjs`, run on EVERY surface. Reject semantics (default, Ben-vetoable):
  screens DROP reject (counted in `--stats`) and FLAG caution; explicit asks/held/watchlist are
  NEVER hidden — full results printed. Open Ben question at P2: a "rejected: N (top 3 + reasons)"
  screen footer, or is `--stats` enough?
- **Path engine (`js/paths.mjs`):** Path = `{key, thesis, action∈BUY/HOLD/LIST/CUT/AVOID, levels,
  tripwire, horizon, economics, viability, evidence}`; `enumeratePaths` + `weighPaths`; headline
  dominant + weighed alternatives (alternatives are decision support, NEVER alert inputs);
  `enteredUnder` tracked; MIGRATION flag when dominant ≠ enteredUnder. Dominance/migration are
  persistence-gated (convictionGate arm-then-confirm + a hysteresis margin) — no path-level
  whiplash. Single-alert / V5 EMIT / Gate-2-CUT-exempt contracts preserved verbatim.
- **offerVerdict layering:** stays a small placement primitive ("is this bid valid under ITS
  path?"). A resting bid IS a position → the path engine runs on bids; **CANCEL-BID becomes
  emergent** (no enumerated path validates the capital); falling→CANCEL-BID survives only as the
  path-less default.
- **Strategy = declarative spec** (`js/strategies.mjs`): `{key, surface:{gates,edge},
  validators:[keys], entry/exit/tripwire, holdDiscipline, migrateTo}` — scripts iterate the
  registry, never name niches. Four module kinds with registries + a CONFORMANCE suite (every
  registered validator/path/spec auto-run against the shared archetype fixtures — decay-knife,
  genuine dip, stable band, thin big ticket, falling wide-band; contract shape + no-throw +
  determinism, or CI fails): validators, paths, specs, probes (PM1 — stays output-only, never a
  gate).
- **Quarantine (`ignored-items.json`) unchanged:** it solves intent-not-in-the-log, which
  validators can't; its v2 home is the position stage (filters merch VIEWS only — archive stores
  the whole market, screens may surface ignored items, pricing on asks ungated). P6 enhancement:
  greenlist entries gain an optional suggestion-emit pointer.
- **Encoding boundary:** encode everything mechanical-given-data; judgment stays for novel events
  / taste / placeholder-era thresholds; the split is "scripts compute the weighed menu with
  evidence; Ben picks". Skills improvement loop: fixture-first; prose only with a `judgment:` tag;
  pointers not copies; enforced by `pipeline/skill-lint.mjs` (P7) + a wave-start drift audit of
  the `judgment:` inventory.

### Chunks (each carries its own reconciling docs pass + README inventory in the same commit)

- **D0 — Snapshot + SQLite archive.** New `pipeline/lib/archive.mjs` (open/append/seriesFor/
  marketAt/exportFixture; WAL; gitignored DB + sidecars); `loadSnapshot()` in `marketfetch.mjs`
  (one immutable per-pass ctx: ts, bulk maps, archive handle, budgeted series); appender with the
  bucket-already-stored pre-check; `loadDaily` re-pointed at the DB (existing `.cache` daily JSON
  = the seed import); decide the ExperimentalWarning suppression. Fixtures: append idempotency,
  seriesFor/marketAt vs hand-computed slices, fixture export; CI never opens the DB.
- **P0 — Context chain + unified held verdict.** `buildItemContext` staged enrichers (pure,
  per-stage fixtures); `quote.mjs --positions` + `watch.mjs` consume it (position stage loads
  offers.json + watch-state for ALL consumers); one shared held-verdict renderer. Pin: a
  `HOLD — ask filling` fixture lot prints identically on both surfaces (today quote.mjs can't —
  no offers read, no conviction timers).
- **P1 — Surface extraction + replay harness.** `gateCandidates` → `pipeline/lib/
  gatecandidates.mjs` (mechanical, re-point test); extract renderMode's post-fetch doctrine into
  pure exported `surviveMode(mode, ctx) → {keep, discardReason}` (falling/rising-confirm/posture/
  phase-rescue — currently untested inline; reuse the existing `--stats` discard counters as the
  return shape); fixture `rankAndSlice`/`proxyDrift`; snapshot-replay acceptance harness off D0's
  fixture format (archetype snapshots → full per-niche funnel → golden outputs) + CI
  `screen-fixtures` step. Pre-amendment falling behavior pinned, re-pinned at P5 (the diff IS the
  doctrine change).
- **P2 — Validate + `reachValidator`, every surface.** `js/validate.mjs` registry; move
  `windowread.mjs` → `js/` (update `windowrange.mjs`/`watch.mjs` imports same commit);
  reachValidator wraps windowread reach + RC1; wire into `screen.mjs` AND `quote.mjs`; reject
  semantics per default above (ask Ben the footer question); widen `suggestionEntry` with
  validator results (lean-included, `?? null`-compatible).
- **P3 — `floorValidator` + term structure.** 1/3/7/14/28d term-structure + typical-fluctuation
  read as pure functions over the Tier-1 archive (PLAN-VALUE §C was spec-only — this BUILDS it);
  runs at gate time whole-market. Reject/caution a BUY not near a durable multi-week floor.
  Acceptance: synthetic decay-knife (band-top reach 0/7, live above the multi-week floor) →
  reject/caution on BOTH surfaces; genuine dip (live below window floor, reach 7/7) → pass.
- **P4a — Path engine core (pure).** `js/paths.mjs` enumerate/weigh; generalize `holdthesis.mjs`
  (entries grow `path`/`enteredUnder`; legacy entries valid; `thesis.mjs --path`); widen `lotCtx`
  with `path`. Acceptance: decay-knife held → value-hold/hold-recovery LOW, scalp/be-escape
  higher; Gate-2-CUT-exempt unchanged.
- **P4b — Persistence + migration + held wiring.** `currentPath`/`enteredUnder` on watch-state
  `held:<id>`; arm-then-confirm + hysteresis on dominance/migration; wire into `watch.mjs` +
  `quote.mjs --positions` (P0's renderer becomes the dominant-path renderer). Acceptance:
  flapping weights never flip a headline inside persistMs; a real migration arms → headlines;
  entered-under-`hold-recovery` decay-knife raises migration toward be-escape/cut.
- **P4c — Declarative specs + surfacing-side paths.** `js/strategies.mjs`; band/spread/rising/
  churn re-expressed as specs, output byte-identical to the P1 goldens (the refactor-proof);
  screen shows the weighed path set per candidate; inferred-default entry path from the surfacing
  spec via the suggestions ledger; conformance suite lands here.
- **P5 — scalp/value specs + path-aware bids + falling doctrine.** `offerVerdict` takes path
  context; CANCEL-BID emergent; scalp spec (falling + wide fresh intraday band ≥ tax+margin,
  reach-validated on today's high, flip-only/no-hold, hard intraday stop — unsold lap migrates to
  `cut`, never `hold-recovery`); value spec (multi-week floor hold, P3 term structure);
  falling-exclusion becomes per-spec. Ships provisional + off-by-default (`--mode scalp`).
  Acceptance: path-less bid on a faller still CANCEL-BIDs; a scalp-path bid doesn't.
- **P6 — Evidence-based viability.** Walk-forward replay per (item, path) over the archive
  (`backtestPlan` precedent) feeding `weighPaths` as `{score, n, span}` with small-n honesty +
  placeholder fallback; retro-join script scoring `suggestions.jsonl` (+archives) × `fills.json`
  outcomes by path type; greenlist→suggestion-emit pointer. Feeds F1.
- **P7 — Docs/skills triage + skill-lint + CLAUDE.md diet.** Three-way triage
  (encode/keep-as-judgment/retire) of EVERY prose rule in the four market skills + the memory
  index, disposition table in the PR; new `pipeline/skill-lint.mjs` in CI (rule-blocks need a
  code pointer or `judgment:` tag; warn on untagged-prose growth); CLAUDE.md slims to routing +
  process rules + pointers, lore → `docs/LORE.md`; `MONITORING.md` emit contract → headline+
  alternatives; README reconciliation sweep; grep-and-fix everything the falling amendment
  supersedes.
- **P8 — Desk orchestrator (after P0–P5 harden).** `pipeline/desk.mjs`: cold start → sync-fills
  → snapshot → positions review → weighed action menu → drives the watch loop (the `/loop`
  target). One process owns cadence + appends (serialized writers by construction) but
  `archive.mjs` keeps WAL safety for ad-hoc runs. FUTURE (out of scope): time-of-day/history
  cold-start suggestions (`--posture auto` + windowread are the ingredients).

### watch.mjs under v2 (contract, load-bearing)

Output contract unchanged (headline alerts → numbers table → per-item notes → footer; V5
always-emit sell/list-at+BE; V6 advisories stay support). Each tick = one `loadSnapshot()`
(+archive append — the running loop passively accrues P6's data); held notes show
entered-under/dominant/alternatives; migration is a NOTE until it survives persistMs; bid rows
get path-relative feedback. The `/loop` pattern, daemon zero-git rule, heartbeat, and
`quote.mjs --positions` as the booked-lots view all stand.

### Honesty (rule 4)

Validator thresholds ship as named placeholders; viability is evidence-scored with printed
sample sizes and a fallback when n is small; scalp is the hardest niche (adverse selection on
the knife) — provisional + off-by-default until P6 evidence says otherwise.

## Other unscheduled notes

- **Verdict-layer temporal memory (V1–V6) — DONE, `PLAN-VERDICT.md` folded + deleted.** The whole
  series gave the watch loop cross-pass memory, conviction gating, a standard emit contract, and an
  advisory recovery-read + capital companion WITHOUT touching pure `momVerdict`/`offerVerdict` (the
  temporal + advisory layers live OUTSIDE the pure core; only V3's optional `lotCtx` arg touched it,
  and that's a no-op when omitted). Shas in the Status table (V1+V2 `8a5d160`, V3 `692baee`, V4
  `2a87269`, V5 `825469f`, V6 this commit). Documented follow-on (NOT built): app Watch-tab adoption
  of the same context lines (the app has no per-pass store — console-first was deliberate).
- **Screen pre-filter heuristic from a pattern study:** the niche screens do a blind
  fetch-and-check (esp. `rising`: ~30 of 40 top candidates discarded after the expensive
  per-item confirm). Study: dump cheap 24h/band features + survive/discard labels for a
  100–200-item sample; if a clean predictor separates, use it as a pre-rank filter.
  Belongs with rating-cutoff calibration (both need the same validation data).
- **Per-item "recommend price adjustment" button** (Trends): deferred; T2's 2h readout is
  a step toward it, F1's calibration is the real enabler.
- **In-app re-scan** (ex PLAN-2 C3): browser CAN rebuild the band scan (~26 CORS-open
  requests); build only if published-scan staleness proves annoying. IndexedDB cache +
  courtesy rates if built.
- **Bank-visibility tooling — DEFERRED** (2026-07-03, Ben's call): bank data is a manual,
  always-stale clipboard export — no auto-sync possible; auto-reconciling it against live
  `positions.json` risks false discrepancies. Edge cases already handled (`unmatched`
  sells, `BANKED` basis, `WITHDRAWN` for off-GE disposal). If revisited: one baseline
  export + GE-log replay = rolling estimate; bank truth stays advisory, never injected
  into `fills.json`. Full rationale: `git show 39e5d23:PLAN.md` (chunk 5 section).

### Needs a Ben decision (not scheduled — list only, don't action unprompted)
- ~~**Stale remote branches** `wave4-repo-review-plan` + `g1-readme-inventory`~~ — RESOLVED
  2026-07-08: Ben confirmed, both deleted from origin (only `main` remains). The first PR-path
  smoke once `gh auth refresh -s repo` runs will use a fresh branch.
- ~~**`pipeline/held-override.json`** (desk, untracked)~~ — RESOLVED 2026-07-06: `rm`'d. It was
  inert (`monitor.mjs` reads `.cache/held-override.json`, not this root copy — it forked at OR2) AND
  redundant (its one entry, `23959` @ 2026-07-03, already reconciles to 0 open in `positions.json`
  via the coffer-manual.log tombstones). Nothing read it. (The other two desk orphans —
  `pipeline/mapping.cache.json` and the SL1-forked `pipeline/suggestions.jsonl` — were cleaned +
  folded 2026-07-05.)
- ~~**Orphan `yield-improvement-brief.md`**~~ — RESOLVED 2026-07-08: Ben OK'd, `rm`'d (it was
  untracked; the YIELD program's content lives in PLAN.md/CHANGELOG).
- **N1 delivery-mechanism trial** — pick option a/b/c after the live scheduled-Claude-session trial.
- **Smaller product calls (from Discovered):** side-specific price-alert semantics; a mobile
  REMOVE editor for already-synced fills; a `--niche` keyword flag on `screen.mjs`; the
  `--max-price` default vs big tickets; a churn-niche `--min-gpd` exemption.

## Out of scope (standing decisions — don't re-open without Ben)

- App-native offer polling loop — the agent-run `watch.mjs` + `/loop` routine stays.
- RuneLite-Android / mobile auto-capture — wrong client.
- Cloud backend / PC-as-server — GitHub-as-backend chosen.
- `momVerdict`/cut-trigger changes from T1 — momentum strength is display-only for now.
- Rating cutoff/weight calibration — placeholder values stay until the validation study.
- Converting skills to subagents — scripts do the heavy lifting; skills encode judgment.

  reconciliation. Chunk 6 (memory pass) → K2; Gate-0 gap → Q1.
- ✅ **Waves 1–7 + LW/LH** (2026-07-04…07-05): shipped per the Status table above; per-chunk
  executor detail folded out 2026-07-06 (recoverable via `git show <sha>:PLAN.md`).

## Discovered

**Open:**
- **PM1 follow-ons (deliberate, not scope-cut — PM1 `6aba80b`, 2026-07-08):** (1) the **watch
  surface** for probes — dip inverts to "average-down window" on an owned lot (the framing is
  already coded in `modules/dip.mjs` behind `ctx.owned`; wiring watch.mjs to run probes is the
  chunk); (2) an **app `Probes` column** (APP_VERSION bump — separate step, published-cells
  contract change); (3) ~~firing logs~~ — SHIPPED as **PM2** `5ca4f95`; the remaining piece is
  the **SCORING pass** (read `pipeline/modules/<name>.log`, judge hit/miss against subsequent
  price action, graduate-or-delete — needs firings to accrue first). decant also models no
  decant fee/low-dose fill liquidity — documented in-file, a firing is a prompt to check, not
  an edge.
- **TG1 follow-on (deliberate):** the app Watch tab could adopt the declared `hold-thesis.json`
  silence (it currently shows the ungated verdict) — separate chunk, APP_VERSION bump.
- **P2 follow-ons (2026-07-08):** (1) `reachValidator` has NO live consumer — screen/quote lack
  `ts1h`, so the reach gate can't fire; wire it into `watch.mjs` (which fetches ts1h per target)
  or give screen/quote a budgeted top-rows ts1h fetch. (2) the screen drop/footer/caution paths
  are validator-unit-tested but not exercised end-to-end — a synthetic reject forced through
  `renderMode` (replay-harness archetype?) would close the gap.
- **P3 follow-ons (2026-07-08):** floorValidator is not yet driven by a declarative strategy
  spec — the `ctx.floor.level` namespace is the natural hook for P4c/P5's per-strategy buy
  candidate (and where the falling-doctrine amendment's history/typical-fluctuation review
  gets its numbers). Its direction-agnosticism (mid-range buy on a risen item → caution) is a
  deliberate conservatism to revisit with F1/P6 evidence.
- **P0 follow-ons (2026-07-08, from the lane's honest report):** (1) quote `--positions`
  conviction runs WITHOUT the structural-support arm (booked-lots view fetches no ts1h, so
  `support/cutTrigger` are null — timers present, support-break arm absent); P4b could thread
  them in, or quote could add a ts1h fetch. (2) the position stage computes `newStateEntry` but
  only watch persists it — a P8 desk orchestrator owning the single writer could let quote
  contribute observations to the shared watch-state too.
- No `--niche` keyword flag on `screen.mjs` (skills filter output rows by hand; a flag is
  a possible future convenience).
- `quote.mjs` and `screen.mjs` can log a different liquidity `class` for the same item in
  `suggestions.jsonl` (volume read from `fetch24hOne` vs bulk `loadAll24h` at different
  moments — observed live on Toxic blowpipe: `mid` vs `thin`). Honest as-computed-then
  data, but unify the volume source if a single canonical label is ever needed (lane O,
  2026-07-04).
- `js/backup.js:23` stamps the backup filename with the UTC date (`toISOString().slice(0,10)`)
  — a late-evening local backup gets tomorrow's date in the name. File-artifact only, not a
  displayed time; switch to a local slug if it ever annoys (lane E, 2026-07-04).
- gp-flow ∩ `--max-price` default (45m): big tickets above 45m (Twisted bow, Elder maul…) are
  still excluded by the default price window — the gp-flow path only helps inside it. Not a
  bug; raise `--max-price` (or its default) if Ben wants them surfaced by default (lane S,
  2026-07-04).
- The 500k `--min-gpd` floor nearly empties the churn niche (~2 rated) — expected given churn's
  thin per-unit margins, but if churn should stay useful it may need a niche-specific floor
  exemption (lane S, 2026-07-04).
- Signals render 2-3× during init (`market.js:96-101`: `renderAll` → bare `computeSignals`
  → `archiveWatchlist().then(computeSignals)`) — idempotent, functionally fine; note for a
  future perf pass, not a bug (audit, 2026-07-05).
- `parseGp` exists in both `pipeline/cli.mjs:29` and `js/format.js:24` with slightly
  different behavior — intentional app/pipeline divergence; worth a one-line comment in
  each noting so (audit, 2026-07-05).
- Log-file discovery near-duplicated between `sync-fills.readLogFiles` and
  `offers.readExchangeLog` — partly justified (`--log-dir` override, mobile file); unify
  only if either changes again (audit, 2026-07-05).
- Named price alerts fire on the live mid; side-specific semantics ("alert when I could *sell*
  above Y" = instabuy basis) is a one-line change but a product decision for Ben (lane N,
  2026-07-04).
- Fill-alert dedupe keys on `slot:item:state:date+time` — if the Exchange Logger re-logs an
  identical terminal line at a different timestamp (the re-log behavior that motivated
  `collapseOffers`), a fill could alert twice. Low risk in the 60-min window; watch during the
  N1 live trial (lane N, 2026-07-04).
- No mobile editor for already-synced fills: mobile can edit/delete *pending* rows, but a fill
  already in `positions.json` only offers local "Hide" — a mobile `editManualLog`-equivalent
  (append a REMOVE tombstone for a chosen synced event id via the contents API) is the natural
  follow-up (lane M, 2026-07-04).
- Watchlist write-back stores ids, not names — `watchlist.json` flips names→ids on the first
  mobile toggle. Harmless (`loadRepoWatchlist` resolves both), but hand-editors of that file
  should know (lane M, 2026-07-04).
- `mobile-fills.log` grows unbounded (append-only by design, like `coffer-manual.log`) — a
  future compaction of absorbed/tombstoned lines could trim it (lane M, 2026-07-04).
- `monitor.mjs`'s "HELD POSITIONS" view diverges from the canonical book when tombstones
  exist: it rebuilds a FIFO from the live exchange log(s) only, without applying
  `coffer-manual.log` REMOVE tombstones, so already-purged lots reappear as phantom holds
  (observed live 2026-07-05: 2× enhanced crystal teleport seed @ 3.345m showed held in
  monitor while `positions.json` correctly had 1 open lot — the agent read monitor as truth
  and gave wrong listing advice). Fix direction: fold the manual log's tombstones into
  monitor's in-memory reconstruction (same event pipeline as sync), or label the section
  honestly ("live-log FIFO — may include tombstoned lots"). Watch-loop session, 2026-07-05.
- LH2's blind-warning heuristic can't catch the *false-EMPTY snapshot* restart variant: a
  client bounce made the plugin write a fresh all-slots `EMPTY` snapshot (16:10:02
  2026-07-05) while real offers stood in-game — log is FRESH (so the staleness gate never
  fires) yet every slot reads empty and watch prints NOT LISTED for listed items. Detectable
  signature: an all-slots-EMPTY re-emit burst arriving with no intervening fill/cancel
  terminals while the pipeline FIFO says inventory is held (and/or offers were visible in
  the immediately-prior log state). Display-only warning like LH2, same header channel —
  never verdict input, and EMPTY stays non-evidence for fills (don't resurrect the deleted
  cancel-to-EMPTY inference). Watch-loop session, 2026-07-05.
- **[✅ SHIPPED as YP1 `a93da6a`]** **Guide-price update tracking → predict the re-anchor (Ben, 2026-07-06 — wants this as an
  edge for single-item lane flipping).** The GE guide price updates ~once/day per item at an
  item-specific time; the update instantly re-anchors guide-price buyers, compressing (or
  lifting) the realtime ceiling — observed live: bludgeon guide 17.61m→17.43m between 21:48
  and 00:03, fury 2.80m→2.72m the same evening, and both of the day's above-average bludgeon
  ask fills printed while the ask sat UNDER the pre-update guide. Capture already shipped
  (watch.mjs `logGuideChanges` → TRACKED `pipeline/.guide-history.jsonl`, change-only
  lines `{ts,id,name,guide,prev}` at watch cadence, so update time pins to ~15 min). The
  chunk to build once samples accrue: per-item update-time estimate + magnitude model
  (yesterday's realtime drift ≈ today's guide step), surfaced as a line on `quote.mjs`/
  `watch.mjs` rows ("guide update expected ~23:00, projected ≈17.2m") and folded into the
  ask-pricing doctrine (price asks against the POST-update guide when the update lands
  before the sell window). Honesty: 2 observed updates so far — needs days of history
  before the timing claim is real. Watch-loop session, 2026-07-06.
- P1's `dedupeSnapshots()` runs inside `reconstruct()` (positions.json + `monitor.mjs`), but
  `outcomes.mjs` calls `collapseOffers`/`matchTrades` directly for campaign boundaries, so its
  campaigns can still see a snapshot-duplicate terminal as a phantom offer. Low impact (outcomes
  is derived/gitignored), but adopt `dedupeSnapshots` there if campaign counts ever look off
  (P1, 2026-07-05).
- **[✅ SHIPPED as FC1 `0e48b2c` — opt-in, OFF by default so decision paths stay byte-identical]**
  **Cross-invocation fetch cache for the CLI scripts → chunk FC1 (Ben, 2026-07-06 — cut
  redundant GE API pulls).** Each pipeline script (`watch.mjs`, `screen.mjs`, `quote.mjs`,
  `windowrange.mjs`) spawns a cold `node` process with no shared fetch state, so running a
  `windowrange` right after a `screen` re-pulls `/latest` + `/5m` + `/24h` rows the screen
  already fetched seconds earlier — and a tight watch loop re-pulls the full quote stack per
  item every pass even on a quiet, unchanged book. The browser app already dedupes within a
  session (`js/marketfetch.js` `fetchTs`/`fetch24h` in-memory store) but the CLI has no
  equivalent across processes. **Spec:** a small file-backed TTL cache in `$TMPDIR` (or a
  gitignored `pipeline/.fetch-cache/`) wrapping the shared CLI fetch layer — key on
  endpoint+item, store the JSON with a fetched-at stamp, serve from cache when age < TTL
  (~60s for `/latest`/`/5m`; longer, ~10–15 min, for `/24h` and the 1h timeseries which move
  slowly), bypass on a `--no-cache`/`--fresh` flag and for any write-committing path. Must be
  a pure wrapper: **byte-identical numbers** (a cache hit returns the same payload a live
  fetch would have within the TTL), gitignored, and inventory-registered in README at
  creation. Measure first — confirm the endpoint layer is genuinely shared before building, and
  size the TTLs so a stale cache can never feed a *decision* (a held/bid quote a verdict runs
  on should stay short-TTL or bypass). Honesty: the win is real on back-to-back reads and quiet
  loops; it does nothing for a book that's actually moving (cache correctly misses on fresh
  data). Behavioral mitigations already in place (loop at 3m not 1m; don't double-run
  `windowrange` when watch's window line answers it) capture most of the idle savings without
  this — FC1 is the structural fix for the screen→windowrange→watch same-item overlap. Watch-loop
  session, 2026-07-06.

**Resolved / promoted:** `gateCandidates` testability → chunk **GC1**; LF/CRLF warnings →
chunk **GA1**; `fetchInputs` triplication → chunk **X1**; `suggestions.jsonl` unbounded growth
→ chunk **SR1**; README pipeline-inventory gap → shipped in **D1**; cross-invocation fetch cache →
shipped as **FC1**; guide re-anchor prediction → shipped as **YP1** (both in the YIELD wave).
The YIELD wave also left these DEFERRED (honesty-gated, not dropped): in-app fill-probability + the
Trends "recommend price adjustment" button (both need **F1** open + a published outcomes artifact);
`outcomes.mjs` `dedupeSnapshots` gap is now CLOSED (YS1). The scan per-row velocity tag deferral is
now **SHIPPED** (`7502889`) as a stdout velocity FOOTNOTE (`lib/velocitytag.mjs` reads the gitignored
`outcomes.json`) rather than a table column — kept out of the published cells so the canonical
table/`screen.json`/app contract stay byte-identical (same discipline as the phase fold). Also
shipped post-YIELD: **total-capital view** (`2fdae81`) — `capitalutil.totalCapital` + `lib/cashstate.mjs`
+ `pipeline/cash.mjs` add a committed + STATED idle-cash line to the watch footer (idle GP is in no
log, so it's a stated snapshot, staleness-bannered, never a verdict input). Earlier per-plan Discovered
lists (chunks 4/8/10 fixes) are preserved in git history — `git show 39e5d23:PLAN.md`.
