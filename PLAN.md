# PLAN — The Coffer master plan (single plan file, 2026-07-04)

This is the **only** plan file. The prior docs — `PLAN-2.md`, `PLAN-3.md`, `PLAN-4.md`,
`PLAN-5.md` — are deleted; their full text (rationale, findings, long-form specs) lives in
git history: `git show 39e5d23:PLAN-4.md` (same sha serves all four). Every chunk below is
self-sufficient for an executor; the git-show pointers are backstory, not required reading.
When a chunk ships, mark it ✅ in the Status table **in this file** with the commit sha —
single-file discipline: this doc is both the plan and the scoreboard.

**Shipped-chunk detail lives in the commits, not here (Ben, 2026-07-09).** A ✅ Status row is
just the sha (+ APP_VERSION where one shipped): the full "what/why/don't-rebuild" story is the
landing commit's message (`git show <sha>`) and `CHANGELOG.md`; load-bearing invariants live in
the headers of the modules/tests that govern them (CLAUDE.md "Where shipped work is
documented"). The last PLAN.md revision carrying the long per-row summaries is
`git show 4753e44:PLAN.md`. Only still-open work keeps its detailed spec here.

## Executor rules (apply to every chunk, verbatim)

- Each chunk ends with: `node --check` every touched `js/*.js` / `pipeline/*.mjs`; run
  `node pipeline/run-tests.mjs` (the auto-discovery runner — runs every `pipeline/**/*.test.mjs`)
  if any tested module was touched; a real browser or Playwright
  smoke test for any app-facing change (ES modules don't load over `file://` — use
  `serve.cmd`); `APP_VERSION` bump in `js/state.js` if app behavior changed (skills-only
  changes do NOT bump it — SKILL.md `version:` frontmatter instead); a descriptive commit,
  then land it (G1, 2026-07-04: `main` is protected by a PR+`checks` ruleset, but there's no
  merge queue on this user-owned repo and PR creation is token-blocked for now, so the
  practical path is **attended direct-push under the admin bypass** — `git fetch && rebase
  origin/main && push`; the `gh pr create`→`gh pr merge` flow is the intent once `gh auth
  refresh` lands — see `/ship` §2/§6) — and if the change touches the deployed app, watch the
  `pages-build-deployment` run to `completed success` (`gh run list -L 1`). Prefer
  exact-string edits that fail loudly.
- Repo is public — no PII in any tracked file or commit message.
- NEVER edit RuneLite's own `exchange.log`; the writable source is the sibling
  `coffer-manual.log`.
- `positions.json` / `fills.json` are pipeline outputs — only `sync-fills.mjs` writes them.
- `git add` only the files you changed. (There is no longer a scheduler auto-committing
  positions/fills — sync is on-demand since G1; but an attended sync push or another lane's
  merge can still move `main`, so rebase your branch on `origin/main` if it drifts.)
- Discover unrelated debt → append to "Discovered" at the bottom; don't fix drive-by.
- **Spec style:** write the rule + one cheap named anchor (e.g. "the bludgeon-exit lesson").
  Do NOT paste live data (prices, multi-item verification lists) — it rots and misleads.
- A reconciling documentation pass is part of every chunk (CLAUDE.md process rule 8):
  grep for statements the change supersedes and fix them in place — move, never copy.

## Dispatch model — coordinator + Opus subagents

- Ben's main session is the **coordinator**. It hands one chunk ID per **Opus subagent**
  (Agent tool). Subagent brief template: *"Read CLAUDE.md fully, then PLAN.md's Executor
  rules and chunk `<ID>`. Execute the chunk, validate per the rules, commit."*
- **Landing (G1, 2026-07-04):** `main` is protected by a PR+`checks` ruleset with a
  repository-admin **always** bypass. Because there's **no merge queue** (user-owned repo —
  unavailable) and **PR creation is currently token-blocked** (`createPullRequest` →
  `FORBIDDEN`, needs `gh auth refresh -s repo`), chunks land today by **attended direct-push
  under the admin bypass**; the coordinator still **hand-rebases each finished lane onto
  `main`** and pushes (parallel lanes use worktree isolation, `isolation: "worktree"`).
  Never force-push `main`. The PR-per-lane flow (which would let the queue serialize lanes)
  is the intent once the token is refreshed *and* the repo has a queue — see `/ship` §2/§6.
- **Parallel-safety rule:** chunks may run concurrently only when their primary-file sets
  are disjoint (listed per chunk). Same-file-different-region overlaps are acceptable
  (git merges them); same-function overlaps are not — sequence those.
- After each wave the coordinator: runs the test file + a browser smoke pass if the app
  changed, updates the Status table here, pushes.
- **Wave-start consistency scan (Wave 2 onward — Ben, 2026-07-04):** when kicking off each
  wave after the first, the coordinator also spawns a **Sonnet** subagent to sweep the
  repo's docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `PLAN.md`, `README.md`, `pipeline/*.md`,
  `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`) for drift the prior wave left behind — statements a shipped
  chunk superseded, stale column sets/verdict lists, chunk specs contradicted by what
  actually landed. Findings are wrapped into followup notes appended to that wave's chunk
  briefs (doc fixes ride with the owning chunk's reconciliation pass); findings that
  belong to no active chunk go to the Discovered list.

## Order of operations

Waves 1–7 have all shipped (see Status), and **PM1** (probe-module system) + **TG1**
(thesis-gated hold alerts) shipped 2026-07-08 (Fable lanes; shas in Status — specs pruned per
the fold-out discipline, recoverable via `git show a46e69a:PLAN.md`), followed the same day by
**PM2** (probe firing logs), **SR1** (suggestions rotation) and **GA1** (`.gitattributes`) —
shas in Status. **The Pipeline-v2 wave (D0→P8, folded from the 2026-07-08 planning round with
Ben) is now the active program** — specs below under "Pipeline v2 — open chunk specs"; F1 stays
gated on O1 thresholds (P6's evidence work feeds it). Everything else lives in the Discovered /
Needs-a-Ben-decision lists. The planning process itself is documented in `docs/PLANNING.md`.

| Wave | What (all ✅ — detail via `git show <sha>:PLAN.md`) |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | T1→T2 (tables + Trends) ∥ O1 (outcomes dataset) ∥ K1→K2→K3 (self-improving skills + memory dedupe + CLAUDE.md slimming) |
| **2** | S1→S2→S3 (screening economics → overnight posture → watchlist section) ∥ Q1 (Gate-0 reliability fix) ∥ E1 (local-time audit) |
| **3** | L1 (action logging) → G1 (PR flow + ruleset) → M1 (mobile parity) → N1 (push notifications) |
| **4** | Repo-review cleanup: D1 (doc reconciliation) ∥ R1→P1 (reconstruct harness → snapshot dedupe) ∥ X2→X1 (dead-scheduler excision → pipeline dedup) ∥ A1→A2→A3 (app dead-code → fetch unification → ledger split) ∥ BE1 (break-even tax-cap fix). W1 (analysis cadence) + CI1 (browser smoke in CI) independent. |
| **5** | UX round: TB1→LU1→FX1 (sortable table → Ledger UX → Finder/Signals fixes) ∥ NY1→NY2 (scan niche-yield audit → ruling) ∥ SY1 (sync-fills doctrine). |
| **6** | Business-logic tests + org: OR1 (org map docs) → OR2 (pipeline/lib/ split) → TD1 (money tests) → TD2 (extractions + tests) → TD3 (nice-to-have sweep). |
| **LW/LH** | LW1→LW2→LW3 (local log-watcher) ∥ LH1→LH2→LH3 (exchange-log hardening) — folded from standalone plan files, both shipped. |
| **7** | TC1 (trendcore extraction) ∥ GC1 (gateCandidates extraction) ∥ SL1 (suggestlog path regression). |
| **YIELD** | Yield-improvement program (folded from `PLAN-YIELD.md`, all shipped 2026-07-06): FC1 (fetch cache) → YF1 (historical market-state helper) → YS1 (outcomes v2 schema) ∥ YS2 (forward suggestion enrichment) → YV1 (velocity+capital-util #3) → YT1 (session-thesis #4) ∥ YP2 (state-transition scan #2) → YP1 (guide re-anchor #2, gated) → YA1 (in-app utilization #5). Full story: `CHANGELOG.md`. |
| **V2** | Pipeline v2 (ACTIVE): D0 (snapshot+SQLite archive) → P0 (context chain) → P1 (surface extraction + replay harness) → P2/P3 (validators, every surface) → P4a/b/c (path engine → persistence → declarative specs) → P5 (scalp/value + path-aware bids) → P6 (evidence viability) → P7 (docs/skills triage + skill-lint) → P8 (desk orchestrator). D0 ∥ P1-mechanical parallel-safe (disjoint primaries). |
| gated | **F1** (algorithm feedback) — opens only when O1's sample thresholds clear |

## Open chunk specs

### F1 — Algorithm feedback loop (GATED on O1's n thresholds)

The payoff of O1. Fill-probability/fill-time curves by band-percentile × item class →
replace `patientTargets`' fixed 20th/80th percentiles with class-conditional choices;
observed time-to-fill replaces `Exp gp/d`'s cycle-time assumptions; realized-vs-suggested
calibration report (the O1 suggestion join makes it a query). Known confound: regime mix —
bucket outcomes by regime label before believing any curve. Do not start until O1's
documented sample thresholds clear (n≥30 per side×pctl×class×regime cell, ≥5 cells —
currently 1; process rule 4). Realistically weeks of accrual away at ~20 lots/day.

---

## Pipeline v2 — open chunk specs (folded from the 2026-07-08 planning round; ACTIVE)

**Problem.** The pipeline "fights itself": scripts disagree on the same item, judgment lives as
prose in skills, and a verdict is treated as a property of the item alone when it is really
**(item × the strategy thesis you entered under)** — anchor incident: the Hydra leather buy
(13.5m mid-decay, NOT the multi-week floor; no script ran the reach/floor checks that were prose
in `/scan`), then whiplash hold/cut advice from the `quote.mjs`-vs-`watch.mjs` verdict fork.
Three roots, three fixes: different fetch instants → the Snapshot layer (D0); forked verdict
logic → the Context chain + one judgment home in `js/` (P0/P4); per-surface gate differences →
shared validators on every surface (P2/P3).

**Ben's rulings (2026-07-08):** falling-exclusion doctrine AMENDED (falling ≠ auto-bad; needs
history/typical-fluctuation review; no CANCEL-BID off falling regime alone for a deliberate
thesis — memory `falling-exclusion-amended`); evidence-based viability, not hand weights; ONE
verdict home (`js/`); declarative strategy specs; every single-item analysis runs validation;
encode-in-scripts wherever mechanical; SQLite archive may grow ~100GB; app work DEFERRED (Ben
isn't using it; stale tabs may be archived) — no APP_VERSION bumps in this wave.

**Ben's rulings (2026-07-09) — ENCODED at P6a/P6b, kept here only as pointers:** the TTF ruling
(every suggestion carries a data-justified Time-to-Flip; shared time-analysis layer; missed
deadline = adaptation trigger; ground truth = retro-join latency, never touch-proxies) and the
ranking ruling ("I despise gp/d…" → rank = net after tax × P(fill at the quoted pair) ÷ TTF,
per thesis; the price-basis principle: ONE pair per suggestion, all three factors evaluated at
it) live in `pipeline/lib/estimators.mjs`'s header + the `6c3f1b5`/`a21f1bc` commit messages;
`pipeline/retrojoin.mjs` is the calibrator. Archive-gap note (verified 2026-07-09): whole-market
daily/1h history is server-backfillable (`loadDaily`'s `?timestamp=` reaches past windows;
per-item `/timeseries?timestep=1h` ~15d) — the local SQLite archive is an accelerator + the only
home for sub-hour history, not the source of truth the TTF work depends on.

### Architecture

```
Snapshot (D0) ─▶ Surface ─▶ Context chain ─▶ VALIDATE ─▶ PATH ENGINE ─▶ Render (per-script)
```

- **Data tiers:** Tier 0 = live bulk (`/latest`,`/24h`, 3–4 fetches/tick total; all surfacing
  gates). Tier 1 = the SQLite archive (`node:sqlite`, verified Node v22.16; thin
  `pipeline/lib/archive.mjs` wrapper) — each run appends the bulk `/1h` AND `/5m` snapshots;
  bulk `/5m` accrual is the only route to broad intraday history (API serves ~30h/item) and
  feeds P6's backtests. Tier 2 = per-item timeseries, budgeted to the fetch pool (existing
  `rankAndSlice` TOP + `fetchTsCached`).
- **No duplicates by construction:** archive ONLY bucketed endpoints (API-supplied bucket ts;
  never `/latest`); PK `(grain, ts, itemId)` + `INSERT OR IGNORE`; check bucket-already-stored
  BEFORE fetching. WAL + busy_timeout for concurrent writers.
- **No-blowup rules:** store only raw observations; EVERYTHING derived (regime, phase, term
  structure, bands, validator results, path scores) is recomputed by pure functions — never
  cached. Append forever (~30–35GB/yr, Ben-approved); `--prune-before` utility ships unused.
- **Context chain:** one `ItemContext` via staged pure enrichers, each owning a namespace,
  nulls degrade downstream (the momVerdict optional-degradation precedent):
  identity → market (Tier 0 row) → history (Tier 1: term structure/phase/fluctuation/window) →
  intraday (Tier 2: ts5m/bands/reach) → position (lot, BE, offers.json, watch-state, thesis/path)
  → validate → paths → render. Scripts = slices of the chain + a renderer.
- **Validate:** registry of pure validators `(ctx) → {status: pass|caution|reject, reason,
  evidence}` in `js/validate.mjs`, run on EVERY surface. Reject semantics (default, Ben-vetoable):
  screens DROP reject (counted in `--stats`) and FLAG caution; explicit asks/held/watchlist are
  NEVER hidden — full results printed.
- **Path engine (`js/paths.mjs`):** Path = `{key, thesis, action∈BUY/HOLD/LIST/CUT/AVOID, levels,
  tripwire, horizon, economics, viability, evidence}`; `enumeratePaths` + `weighPaths`; headline
  dominant + weighed alternatives (alternatives are decision support, NEVER alert inputs);
  `enteredUnder` tracked; MIGRATION flag when dominant ≠ enteredUnder. Dominance/migration are
  persistence-gated (convictionGate arm-then-confirm + a hysteresis margin) — no path-level
  whiplash. Single-alert / V5 EMIT / Gate-2-CUT-exempt contracts preserved verbatim.
- **offerVerdict layering:** stays a small placement primitive ("is this bid valid under ITS
  path?"). A resting bid IS a position → the path engine runs on bids; **CANCEL-BID becomes
  emergent** (no enumerated path validates the capital); falling→CANCEL-BID survives only as the
  path-less default.
- **Strategy = declarative spec** (`js/strategies.mjs`): scripts iterate the registry, never name
  niches. Four module kinds with registries + a CONFORMANCE suite (every registered
  validator/path/spec auto-run against the shared archetype fixtures — decay-knife, genuine dip,
  stable band, thin big ticket, falling wide-band; contract shape + no-throw + determinism, or CI
  fails): validators, paths, specs, probes (PM1 — stays output-only, never a gate).
- **Quarantine (`ignored-items.json`) unchanged:** it solves intent-not-in-the-log, which
  validators can't; its v2 home is the position stage (filters merch VIEWS only — archive stores
  the whole market, screens may surface ignored items, pricing on asks ungated). P6 enhancement:
  greenlist entries gain an optional suggestion-emit pointer.
- **Encoding boundary:** encode everything mechanical-given-data; judgment stays for novel events
  / taste / placeholder-era thresholds; the split is "scripts compute the weighed menu with
  evidence; Ben picks". Skills improvement loop: fixture-first; prose only with a `judgment:` tag;
  pointers not copies; enforced by `pipeline/skill-lint.mjs` (P7) + a wave-start drift audit of
  the `judgment:` inventory.

### Chunks (each carries its own reconciling docs pass + README inventory in the same commit)

**D0, P0–P6c, P7 — SHIPPED.** Specs pruned per the fold-out discipline; shas in Status,
full spec text via `git show 4753e44:PLAN.md` (the last revision before this compaction), and
each chunk's landing commit message is the authoritative "what shipped" record. P7's lone RETIRE
disposition (`docs/SKILL-TRIAGE.md` had exactly 1, not 3) is now executed (`f8de508`, Ben
2026-07-09) — no P7 leftovers.

- **P8 — Desk orchestrator (after P0–P5 harden).** `pipeline/desk.mjs`: cold start → sync-fills
  → snapshot → positions review → weighed action menu → drives the watch loop (the `/loop`
  target). One process owns cadence + appends (serialized writers by construction) but
  `archive.mjs` keeps WAL safety for ad-hoc runs. FUTURE (out of scope): time-of-day/history
  cold-start suggestions (`--posture auto` + windowread are the ingredients).

### watch.mjs under v2 (contract, load-bearing)

Output contract unchanged (headline alerts → numbers table → per-item notes → footer; V5
always-emit sell/list-at+BE; V6 advisories stay support). Each tick = one `loadSnapshot()`
(+archive append — the running loop passively accrues P6's data); held notes show
entered-under/dominant/alternatives; migration is a NOTE until it survives persistMs; bid rows
get path-relative feedback. The `/loop` pattern, daemon zero-git rule, heartbeat, and
`quote.mjs --positions` as the booked-lots view all stand.

### Honesty (rule 4)

Validator thresholds ship as named placeholders; viability is evidence-scored with printed
sample sizes and a fallback when n is small; scalp is the hardest niche (adverse selection on
the knife) — provisional + off-by-default until P6 evidence says otherwise.

## Other unscheduled notes

- **Verdict-layer temporal memory (V1–V6) — DONE, `PLAN-VERDICT.md` folded + deleted.** Cross-pass
  memory, conviction gating, standard emit contract, advisory recovery-read + capital companion —
  all OUTSIDE pure `momVerdict`/`offerVerdict` (only V3's optional `lotCtx` touched it, no-op when
  omitted). Shas in Status. Documented follow-on (NOT built): app Watch-tab adoption of the same
  context lines.
- **Screen pre-filter heuristic from a pattern study:** the niche screens do a blind
  fetch-and-check (esp. `rising`: ~30 of 40 top candidates discarded after the expensive
  per-item confirm). Study: dump cheap 24h/band features + survive/discard labels for a
  100–200-item sample; if a clean predictor separates, use it as a pre-rank filter.
  Belongs with rating-cutoff calibration (both need the same validation data).
- **Per-item "recommend price adjustment" button** (Trends): deferred; T2's 2h readout is
  a step toward it, F1's calibration is the real enabler.
- **Annotated price-path chart — `pipeline/chart.mjs` + app Trends overlay (Ben, 2026-07-10 — "extremely useful in our app").**
  Encode the on-demand annotated chart prototyped this session (the Searing-page artifact:
  90d reprice context + 15d hourly with actionable levels + diurnal hour-of-day profile) into a
  reusable capability. Two deliverables, shared plumbing:
  1. **CLI** `node pipeline/chart.mjs "<item or id>"` → emits a self-contained annotated HTML
     (or SVG) so any desk decision gets a picture without hand-building it — same fewer-scripts-
     on-the-fly rationale as `limits.mjs`/`quote.mjs`. Data via the shared `fetchTs`/`fetchLatest`
     (`marketfetch.mjs`); annotations (buy/break-even/ask rungs, dip/peak windows) reuse
     `computeQuote` + `windowread.mjs`'s `hourProfile`/`deriveDiurnalRange` so the levels are
     byte-identical to the tables.
  2. **App Trends tab** — the higher-value half: overlay the SAME annotations (break-even line,
     band edges, diurnal dip/peak shading, live marker) onto the existing Trends chart, and add the
     diurnal hour-of-day profile as a companion view. Client-side off the app's own quote path
     (bumps `APP_VERSION`); the CLI is the node-side twin (no bump). Shared render helper so both
     surfaces draw the same picture — the ONE chart-annotation home, mirroring the `quotecore` split.
  Honesty carries into the render: sample-size + reach caveats stay on the chart (the prototype's
  footnote), and the diurnal profile is an average, not a forecast (the PF-series forecast is the
  separate quantitative layer). Scope note: distinct from the deferred in-browser re-scan below
  (that rebuilds the market scan; this draws one item's history).
- **In-app re-scan** (ex PLAN-2 C3): browser CAN rebuild the band scan (~26 CORS-open
  requests); build only if published-scan staleness proves annoying. IndexedDB cache +
  courtesy rates if built.
- **Bank-visibility tooling — DEFERRED** (2026-07-03, Ben's call): bank data is a manual,
  always-stale clipboard export — no auto-sync possible; auto-reconciling it against live
  `positions.json` risks false discrepancies. Edge cases already handled (`unmatched`
  sells, `BANKED` basis, `WITHDRAWN` for off-GE disposal). If revisited: one baseline
  export + GE-log replay = rolling estimate; bank truth stays advisory, never injected
  into `fills.json`. Full rationale: `git show 39e5d23:PLAN.md` (chunk 5 section).

### Needs a Ben decision (not scheduled — list only, don't action unprompted)
- **`pnl.mjs` — go/no-go (proposed 2026-07-09, script-helper audit; NOT approved).** A standing
  P&L query helper over `positions.json` (realized after-tax closed P/L + open-inventory mark, by
  item / period / watchlist) so a "how am I doing?" ask stops spawning ad-hoc `node -e` reads — the
  same fewer-scripts-on-the-fly rationale that landed `limits.mjs` (LM1). Would share
  `js/ledgercore.js`'s period bucketing so numbers match the app Ledger. Build only on Ben's word.
- **N1 delivery-mechanism trial** — pick option a/b/c after the live scheduled-Claude-session trial.
- **Smaller product calls (from Discovered):** side-specific price-alert semantics; a mobile
  REMOVE editor for already-synced fills; a `--niche` keyword flag on `screen.mjs`; the
  `--max-price` default vs big tickets; a churn-niche `--min-gpd` exemption.
- (Resolved 2026-07-06…08: stale remote branches deleted; `pipeline/held-override.json` +
  `yield-improvement-brief.md` orphans removed — detail in `git show 4753e44:PLAN.md`.)

## Out of scope (standing decisions — don't re-open without Ben)

- App-native offer polling loop — the agent-run `watch.mjs` + `/loop` routine stays.
- RuneLite-Android / mobile auto-capture — wrong client.
- Cloud backend / PC-as-server — GitHub-as-backend chosen.
- `momVerdict`/cut-trigger changes from T1 — momentum strength is display-only for now.
- Rating cutoff/weight calibration — placeholder values stay until the validation study.
- Converting skills to subagents — scripts do the heavy lifting; skills encode judgment.

## Completed (pointers — full detail in commits + CLAUDE.md "Done" + git history)

- ✅ **PLAN chunks 1–10** (2026-07-03): manual-fills vocabulary + tombstones (0.27.0,
  `d867afb`); standard Quick/Opt table + `js/quotecore.js` (0.28.0, `fd586c9`);
  `quote.mjs`/`screen.mjs`/`marketfetch.mjs` (`5b586fb`); debt pass (0.29.0, `0febcbe`);
  `Mom` column + `momVerdict` cut-trigger (0.30.0, `c0a1c58`); `watch.mjs` adaptive
  monitor (`319e254`); unified `reconstruct.mjs` (`181a07c`); niche screens + `Exp gp/d`
  (`2c3ca7e`); `pipeline/cli.mjs` dedup (chunk 10). Bank tooling (chunk 5) deferred — see
  unscheduled notes.
- ✅ **PLAN-2 chunk C** — Finder v2 published-scan (0.31.0), then superseded by the
  niche-rating Scan (per-niche graded tables + `pipeline/rating.mjs`, 0.32.0); C1/C2
  plumbing lives on inside it. B1's safety core shipped as the sync-fills clobber-guard
  (`4711ff5`); the rest of B is M1.
- ✅ **PLAN-3** — underwater-at-tick triage, fully built (0.33.0, `d841cd1`): Gate-0
  reliability + `diurnalRead`/`moveShape`/`underwaterHours` + NO-READ/DIURNAL-WATCH/
  SHOCK-WATCH verdicts + fixtures; `MONITORING.md` step 4 is the tree.
- ✅ **PLAN-5** — project skills `/positions` `/scan` `/overnight` `/morning` + CLAUDE.md
  slimming (`82ba8a5`…`39e5d23`): skills committed, buy limit printed on `quote.mjs`
  regime lines, per-workflow doctrine moved into the skills with the grep-checklist
  reconciliation. Chunk 6 (memory pass) → K2; Gate-0 gap → Q1.
- ✅ **Waves 1–7 + LW/LH** (2026-07-04…07-05): shipped per the Status table above; per-chunk
  executor detail folded out 2026-07-06 (recoverable via `git show <sha>:PLAN.md`).

## Discovered

**ARCH-DOCS-AUDIT codification (from `PLAN-ARCH-DOCS-AUDIT.md`, Q3 "prose → code") — ALL DONE, now in the Status table above:**
COD-2 `81d9049` · COD-3 `5b91d10` · COD-4 `a923496` (plus ARCH-1 `a24d456`, DL1 `ef239dc`, COD-1 `55861d1`).
Full "what/why" per the fold-out discipline = the landing commit messages.

**Open:**
- **Diurnal funnel-widening (fast-follow to the 2026-07-09 diurnal engine):** the hour-of-day
  `hourProfile`/`deriveDiurnalRange` engine + the screen's `Diurnal timing` block auto-run on SURVIVORS
  only (free — series in hand). Ben's open question — "are the gates EXCLUDING items that are profitable
  under the detailed diurnal read?" — needs the bounded experiment: run the profile on a fetch-budgeted
  set of gate-excluded rows (reuse the `subFloorFallback` "peek below the gate" primitive), and LOG which
  would've been profitable at fill-correct diurnal prices → emit a "diurnal candidates" list (NOT
  auto-added to the curated `watchlist.json`; Ben promotes). Costs 1h fetches (the gate funnel's expensive
  step) so it needs a budget. Honest prior (rule 4): the deep read has so far DISQUALIFIED picks (Virtus,
  Ghrazi) as often as promoted, so this may tighten the shelf rather than widen it — either outcome is signal.
- **Value niche lacks the LM1 limit stage (LM1 `9517655`, 2026-07-09):** `--mode value` renders via
  `valueGate`, not `runValidators`, so `limitValidator` doesn't reach it. Provisional/off-by-default
  (n≈0) — wire the limits stage in when the value path grows a validator pass, not before.
- **Spread/rising consolidation — RESOLVED (Steps 3+4, Ben 2026-07-09):** `spread` AND `rising` specs
  DELETED (`js/strategies.mjs`; git history is the reference). SUPERSEDES NY2/NY3. Rising's proxy-first
  fetch ordering absorbed into `rankAndSlice`'s rising reserve; residual thin-big-ticket lane caught by
  band's thin path. Detail: `git show f982a31` + the deletion commits.
- **Traded-band gate (Bar D) — DONE `0ed7aa1` (Ben 2026-07-09).** Decoupled DENSITY (`tradedWin`) from
  TWO-SIDEDNESS (`sawLow && sawHigh`) so genuinely-liquid big tickets stop failing the old both-in-one-5m-
  bucket `active5m` count. Invariant lives in the `bandCore` header (`js/strategies.mjs`); pinned by replay
  archetype 2003.
- **Band EDGE robustness (Bar E) — DONE `dba20b4` (Scope A) + `7056846` (Scope B, 0.55.0).** `robustBand`
  (home in `js/quotecore.js`) takes p90/p10 on a DENSE side, raw extremum on a SPARSE side, killing the
  band-top artifact in both the pipeline `bandCore` edge and the app's Optimistic column. Invariant lives in
  the `robustBand` header; pinned by `pipeline/bandedge.test.mjs` + the `quotecore.test.mjs` Scope-B split.
- **Churn per-lap rank + band partition — DONE `8c84fac` (Step 6, Ben 2026-07-09).** Churn ranks the LAP
  (`net/u × min(limit, feasibleDepth) × P ÷ TTF`) via its own estimator family; `--mode all` partitions
  churn disjoint from band by margin (render-stage, replay goldens untouched). Detail: the landing commit.
- **PM1 follow-ons (deliberate, not scope-cut — PM1 `6aba80b`, 2026-07-08):** (1) the **watch
  surface** for probes — dip inverts to "average-down window" on an owned lot (the framing is
  already coded in `modules/dip.mjs` behind `ctx.owned`; wiring watch.mjs to run probes is the
  chunk); (2) an **app `Probes` column** (APP_VERSION bump — separate step, published-cells
  contract change); (3) ~~firing logs~~ — SHIPPED as **PM2** `5ca4f95`; the remaining piece is
  the **SCORING pass** (read `pipeline/modules/<name>.log`, judge hit/miss against subsequent
  price action, graduate-or-delete — needs firings to accrue first). decant also models no
  decant fee/low-dose fill liquidity — documented in-file, a firing is a prompt to check, not
  an edge.
- **TG1 follow-on (deliberate):** the app Watch tab could adopt the declared `hold-thesis.json`
  silence (it currently shows the ungated verdict) — separate chunk, APP_VERSION bump.
- **P2 follow-ons (2026-07-08):** (1) `reachValidator` has NO live consumer — screen/quote lack
  `ts1h`, so the reach gate can't fire; wire it into `watch.mjs` (which fetches ts1h per target)
  or give screen/quote a budgeted top-rows ts1h fetch. (2) the screen drop/footer/caution paths
  are validator-unit-tested but not exercised end-to-end — a synthetic reject forced through
  `renderMode` (replay-harness archetype?) would close the gap.
- **P3 follow-ons (2026-07-08):** floorValidator is not yet driven by a declarative strategy
  spec — the `ctx.floor.level` namespace is the natural hook for P4c/P5's per-strategy buy
  candidate (and where the falling-doctrine amendment's history/typical-fluctuation review
  gets its numbers). Its direction-agnosticism (mid-range buy on a risen item → caution) is a
  deliberate conservatism to revisit with F1/P6 evidence.
- **P4a follow-ons (2026-07-08):** (1) TWO overlapping thesis stores — gitignored
  `session-thesis.json` (free-text intent) and tracked `hold-thesis.json` (gating, now
  path-carrying) BOTH carry a `tripwire` and are both touched by `thesis.mjs set` (`--tripwire`
  still targets the session one, a string; hold-thesis's is numeric). Pre-existing confusion the
  P4a spec inherited ("sole writer" was wrong); P4b/P7 should unify the CLI surface or split the
  stores' responsibilities in docs. (2) replay archetype 2004's REAL `phase()` likely computes
  `basing` (flat recent lows), not `decay`, despite the "decay-knife" name — P4a's fixtures set
  derived ctx fields directly so it doesn't bite yet, but P4c/P5 wiring off the real series
  should verify the archetype's phase label before leaning on it.
- **P4b follow-on (2026-07-08):** `quote.mjs --positions`' read-only `pathsStage` run mutates
  `ctx.position.newStateEntry` with path fields it never saves — harmless today, but a P8
  single-writer must know the entry is confirm-advanced on quote's clock too if it ever
  persists it.
- **P0 follow-ons (2026-07-08, from the lane's honest report):** (1) quote `--positions`
  conviction runs WITHOUT the structural-support arm (booked-lots view fetches no ts1h, so
  `support/cutTrigger` are null — timers present, support-break arm absent); P4b could thread
  them in, or quote could add a ts1h fetch. (2) the position stage computes `newStateEntry` but
  only watch persists it — a P8 desk orchestrator owning the single writer could let quote
  contribute observations to the shared watch-state too.
- **Guide re-anchor prediction model (follow-on to YP1 `a93da6a`, Ben wants this edge):** capture
  is live (`.guide-history.jsonl`, change-only lines at watch cadence). The chunk to build once
  samples accrue: per-item update-time estimate + magnitude model (yesterday's realtime drift ≈
  today's guide step), surfaced as a line on `quote.mjs`/`watch.mjs` rows and folded into the
  ask-pricing doctrine (price asks against the POST-update guide when the update lands before
  the sell window). Honesty: needs days of history before the timing claim is real.
- No `--niche` keyword flag on `screen.mjs` (skills filter output rows by hand; a flag is
  a possible future convenience).
- **Liquidity-`class` volume-source split (SF-3, pre-F1; = the deferred ARCH-3 half).** `quote.mjs`
  and `screen.mjs` can log a different liquidity `class` for the same item in `suggestions.jsonl`:
  the logged `class` derives from `volDay = min(hpv,lpv)`, and the hpv/lpv come from DIFFERENT
  endpoints — quote's per-item `fetch24hOne`/`/24h?id=` (15-min cache) vs screen's bulk `loadAll24h`/
  `all24h.json` (10-min cache). Different snapshots ⇒ the same item can straddle a `liqClassOf`
  boundary (observed live on Toxic blowpipe: `mid` vs `thin`). `outcomes.mjs` re-derives class from
  the stored `volDay`, so re-deriving does NOT launder it — the polluted quantity is `volDay` itself.
  A calibration pollutant to fix BEFORE F1 opens (F1 is weeks of accrual out → real runway).
  **APPROVED design (Ben 2026-07-10): warm-cache read + volSrc tag, COMBINED (they are complementary,
  not either/or).** (1) **volSrc tag** — ALWAYS log which endpoint the volume came from (`bulk` |
  `peritem`); the honesty layer, lets F1 bucket/normalize. (2) **warm-cache read** — `quote.mjs` reads
  `all24h.json` for the class field ONLY IF it is already warm (within its ~10-min TTL, written by a
  recent scan = a file read, ZERO fetch) → volSrc `bulk`, now agreeing with screen; when cold, keep the
  per-item volume already fetched → volSrc `peritem`, and **NEVER force the ~4000-item bulk fetch for a
  1-item ask** (the hard constraint). Net: converge for free when the data is on disk, fall back
  honestly with a normalizable label when not. Pin class-parity with a small test. Files:
  `pipeline/quote.mjs`, `pipeline/screen.mjs`, `pipeline/lib/suggestlog.mjs`, `pipeline/lib/marketfetch.mjs`
  (lane O 2026-07-04; enriched + approved by the 2026-07-10 sweep — dispatched as a worktree agent).
- `js/backup.js:23` stamps the backup filename with the UTC date (`toISOString().slice(0,10)`)
  — a late-evening local backup gets tomorrow's date in the name. File-artifact only, not a
  displayed time; switch to a local slug if it ever annoys (lane E, 2026-07-04).
- gp-flow ∩ `--max-price` default (45m): big tickets above 45m (Twisted bow, Elder maul…) are
  still excluded by the default price window — the gp-flow path only helps inside it. Not a
  bug; raise `--max-price` (or its default) if Ben wants them surfaced by default (lane S,
  2026-07-04).
- The 500k `--min-gpd` floor nearly empties the churn niche (~2 rated) — expected given churn's
  thin per-unit margins, but if churn should stay useful it may need a niche-specific floor
  exemption (lane S, 2026-07-04).
- Signals render 2-3× during init (`market.js:96-101`: `renderAll` → bare `computeSignals`
  → `archiveWatchlist().then(computeSignals)`) — idempotent, functionally fine; note for a
  future perf pass, not a bug (audit, 2026-07-05).
- ~~`parseGp` divergence comment~~ — **DONE `6808c58`** (ARCH-3 part): cross-comments now in both
  `pipeline/lib/cli.mjs` and `js/format.js` documenting the intentional app/pipeline behavior split.
- **Arch-sweep followups (2026-07-10 review/sweep; the residue after the innocuous fixes landed in
  `ef68792`). None has a demonstrated live cost — hygiene/reuse, not bugs.**
  - ~~**SF-1 (MED) — quantile/median type-7 has THREE copies**~~ — **DONE `2cbca38`** (0.56.0): one
    shared home in `js/quotecore.js` exporting BOTH contracts — `quantileSorted(sortedAsc,q)` (pre-sorted,
    no sort) and `quantileOf(arr,q)`/`median(arr)` (copy+sort, never mutate). termstructure re-exports
    `quantileSorted`; retrojoin uses `quantileOf`. Caller audit preserved every site's sorted/unsorted
    contract; byte-identical (type-7 at q=0.5 IS mean-of-two-middle median), fixture-pinned in
    `quotecore.test.mjs`. APP_VERSION bumped (quotecore.js is app-served; TC1/TD2 precedent).
  - ~~**SF-2 (LOW) — `quote.mjs` per-item ts1h fetch (COD-4) is uncapped across a batch**~~ — **DONE**
    (2026-07-10, comment-only): the amplification (`quote A B C … J` = one 1h fetch per item, budget
    unenforced) is now documented at the fetch site with the soft-cap recipe for if large batches ever
    become routine. Ben ruled the comment sufficient — a soft cap is machinery for a non-problem.
  - **SF-4 (LOW) — two `UA` strings drifted** (`js/marketfetch.js` `0.30`, `pipeline/lib/marketfetch.mjs`
    `0.28`, vs `APP_VERSION 0.55`): the version token is dead-decorative (the wiki API doesn't gate on it;
    the contact string is what matters). Drop the version number from both UAs to kill the drift surface;
    the app-file touch is a rule-5 deployed change (APP_VERSION bump + smoke), so bundle with the next
    genuine app change or SF-1's js/ pass.
  - **SF-5 (cosmetic — skip unless a Finder/forecast pass happens anyway):** `js/market.js:171`
    `ratingParts` terse field names (`roiS/volS/…` vs the spelled-out style); PF1 `js/forecast.mjs`
    `atHours` (dip/peak cluster window) vs `etaH` (global-extremum hour) can point at slightly different
    hours under a sub-`trendDominates` trend (label only — level+eta stay correct); README/commit claim
    "`forecast.mjs` imports windowread" but the module has no import (it consumes a passed-in profile).
- **DOC-5 / ARCH-2 stay Ben-gated proposals** in `PLAN-ARCH-DOCS-AUDIT.md`: DOC-5 = skills anchor
  compression (table-first per the P7 precedent — compress incident STORIES to `rule + anchor + LORE`
  pointer, keep the rules); ARCH-2 = thesis-store unification (the same two-store `tripwire` hazard
  already noted in the P4a follow-on above — a product-semantics ruling, not a mechanical fix). Not
  started by design.
- Log-file discovery near-duplicated between `sync-fills.readLogFiles` and
  `offers.readExchangeLog` — partly justified (`--log-dir` override, mobile file); unify
  only if either changes again (audit, 2026-07-05).
- Named price alerts fire on the live mid; side-specific semantics ("alert when I could *sell*
  above Y" = instabuy basis) is a one-line change but a product decision for Ben (lane N,
  2026-07-04).
- Fill-alert dedupe keys on `slot:item:state:date+time` — if the Exchange Logger re-logs an
  identical terminal line at a different timestamp (the re-log behavior that motivated
  `collapseOffers`), a fill could alert twice. Low risk in the 60-min window; watch during the
  N1 live trial (lane N, 2026-07-04).
- No mobile editor for already-synced fills: mobile can edit/delete *pending* rows, but a fill
  already in `positions.json` only offers local "Hide" — a mobile `editManualLog`-equivalent
  (append a REMOVE tombstone for a chosen synced event id via the contents API) is the natural
  follow-up (lane M, 2026-07-04).
- Watchlist write-back stores ids, not names — `watchlist.json` flips names→ids on the first
  mobile toggle. Harmless (`loadRepoWatchlist` resolves both), but hand-editors of that file
  should know (lane M, 2026-07-04).
- `mobile-fills.log` grows unbounded (append-only by design, like `coffer-manual.log`) — a
  future compaction of absorbed/tombstoned lines could trim it (lane M, 2026-07-04).
- LH2's blind-warning heuristic can't catch the *false-EMPTY snapshot* restart variant: a
  client bounce made the plugin write a fresh all-slots `EMPTY` snapshot (16:10:02
  2026-07-05) while real offers stood in-game — log is FRESH (so the staleness gate never
  fires) yet every slot reads empty and watch prints NOT LISTED for listed items. Detectable
  signature: an all-slots-EMPTY re-emit burst arriving with no intervening fill/cancel
  terminals while the pipeline FIFO says inventory is held (and/or offers were visible in
  the immediately-prior log state). Display-only warning like LH2, same header channel —
  never verdict input, and EMPTY stays non-evidence for fills (don't resurrect the deleted
  cancel-to-EMPTY inference). Watch-loop session, 2026-07-05.
- P1's `dedupeSnapshots()` runs inside `reconstruct()` (positions.json + `monitor.mjs`), but
  `outcomes.mjs` calls `collapseOffers`/`matchTrades` directly for campaign boundaries, so its
  campaigns can still see a snapshot-duplicate terminal as a phantom offer. Low impact (outcomes
  is derived/gitignored), but adopt `dedupeSnapshots` there if campaign counts ever look off
  (P1, 2026-07-05).

**Resolved / promoted:** `gateCandidates` testability → chunk **GC1**; LF/CRLF warnings →
chunk **GA1**; `fetchInputs` triplication → chunk **X1**; `suggestions.jsonl` unbounded growth
→ chunk **SR1**; README pipeline-inventory gap → shipped in **D1**; cross-invocation fetch cache →
shipped as **FC1**; guide re-anchor capture → shipped as **YP1** (prediction model stays Open above).
The YIELD wave also left these DEFERRED (honesty-gated, not dropped): in-app fill-probability + the
Trends "recommend price adjustment" button (both need **F1** open + a published outcomes artifact);
`outcomes.mjs` `dedupeSnapshots` gap is now CLOSED (YS1). The scan per-row velocity tag deferral is
now **SHIPPED** (`7502889`) as a stdout velocity FOOTNOTE (`lib/velocitytag.mjs` reads the gitignored
`outcomes.json`) rather than a table column — kept out of the published cells so the canonical
table/`screen.json`/app contract stay byte-identical (same discipline as the phase fold). Also
shipped post-YIELD: **total-capital view** (`2fdae81`) — `capitalutil.totalCapital` + `lib/cashstate.mjs`
+ `pipeline/cash.mjs` add a committed + STATED idle-cash line to the watch footer (idle GP is in no
log, so it's a stated snapshot, staleness-bannered, never a verdict input). Earlier per-plan Discovered
lists (chunks 4/8/10 fixes) are preserved in git history — `git show 39e5d23:PLAN.md`.
